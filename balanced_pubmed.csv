1,CD010213,0,23188452,0,"Acute pancreatitis: the onset digestive manifestation, in a patient with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.","Acute pancreatitis is a common complication, which occurs with patients suffering from vesicular biliary lithiasis or chronic alcoholism. Hypercalcemia may determine acute pancreatitis, its causes being multiple: primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, metabolic diseases of the bone, metastatic bone neoplasm, as well as lymphoproliferative syndromes caused by the HTLV-1 virus-adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). ATLL is a malignant and aggressive lymphoproliferation with the T-cell, associated with the infection caused by the HTLV-1 retrovirus. Organomegaly, cutaneous conditions, and hypercalcemia represent the main characteristics of the disease. From a hematologic point of view, we can notice the atypical lymphocytes (also known as flower cells, due to the shape of their nucleus), with a distinct CD4+ CD25+ phenotype. There have been reported few cases of patients who showed acute pancreatitis in the onset of the disease. We will describe the case of a patient whose diagnosis has not been an easy one, as it showed multiple complications from a very early stage.","Acute pancreatitis: the onset digestive manifestation, in a patient with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. - Acute pancreatitis is a common complication, which occurs with patients suffering from vesicular biliary lithiasis or chronic alcoholism.

2,CD010213,0,2552085,0,"[Diagnosis of glucagonoma. Value of scanning, echography and arteriography. Apropos of 2 cases and a review of the literature].","The authors report two cases of glucagonoma, a rare endocrine tumor of the pancreas, and describe the data currently found in literature. Glucagonoma is a single and usually large tumor, which develops in the alpha cells of the islets of Langerhans and evolves slowly. The combination of characteristic skin lesions, diabetes and weight loss should lead to searching for hyperglucagonemia and for the pancreatic tumor. The diagnosis is usually made rather late, average evolution is five years before diagnosis when it is detected. Imaging, in particular ultrasound and computed tomography (CT), proves to be necessary for the positive diagnosis of glucagonoma as it localizes the pancreatic mass and plays a role in local assessment, thus providing guidance for surgery. The role of imaging is also fundamental for the detection of metastases, which are the only sign of malignancy as no criterion of benignity is found for this tumor.","[Diagnosis of glucagonoma.

He had a large ill-defined enhancing mass-like lesion in the uncinate process of the pancreas with stricture of the distal common bile duct. Aspiration cytology of the pancreatic mass demonstrated inflammatory cells without evidence of malignancy. Total serum immunoglobulin G level was slightly elevated, but IgG4 level was normal. After the 2-wk 40 mg prednisolone trial, the patient's symptoms and bilirubin level improved significantly. A follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan showed a dramatic resolution of the pancreatic lesion. A low dose steroid was continued. After six months he self-discontinued prednisolone for 3 wk, and was presented with jaundice again. A CT scan showed newly developed intrahepatic biliary dilatation and marked concentric wall thickening of the common hepatic duct and the proximal common bile duct without pancreatic aggravation. The patient's IgG4 level was elevated to 2.51 g/L. Prednisolone was started again, after which his serum bilirubin level became normal and the thickening of the bile duct was resolved. This case suggests that autoimmune pancreatitis can progress to other organs that are not involved at the initial diagnosis, even with sustained pancreatic remission.","Newly developed autoimmune cholangitis without relapse of autoimmune pancreatitis after discontinuing prednisolone. - A 57-year-old man presented with a 2-wk history of painless jaundice and weight loss.

In four out of five patients, computed tomography, magnetic resonance and angiography failed to show any tumor. In just one single case, these imaging methods showed the pancreatic tumor. All patients were studied by selective intraarterial pancreatic stimulation (SIPS): a) infusion of calcium gluconate (0.025 mEq/kg) in each artery that supplies the pancreas: gastroduodenal, superior mesenteric and splenic arteries as well as the hepatic artery; b) insulin venous sampling in the right supra-hepatic vein at 30 and 60 seconds after arterial stimulation (in one patient an additional sample at 90 seconds was obtained).

8,CD010213,0,8698553,0,Radiologic evaluation of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation.,"We describe the radiographic imaging modalities that were used in the first twelve consecutive patients who have undergone simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation (SPK) at our institution. The total number of examinations undertaken in this study included ultrasound (n = 22), radionucleide scanning (n = 19), cystography (n = 14), computed tomography (n = 2) and magnetic resonance imaging (n = 1). Eighteen percent (5/22) ultrasound examinations were abnormal (perirenal collection [n = 4], peri-pancreatic collection [n = 1]. Two collections required aspiration and were confirmed as lymphocoeles. Cystography showed ureteric reflux in two patients and radionucleide DTPA scanning revealed a delay in the excretory phase in 20% of patients. CT was used in two patients with SPK and demonstrated large peri-pancreatic collections. No episodes of rejection or late graft pancreatitis were noted in this series. We discuss the role of radiographic imaging in detecting early graft failure and also in defining the surgical complications that may arise following transplantation. We also outline the merits and disadvantages of each imaging modality. We conclude that the most useful initial imaging techniques in the evaluation of patients following SPK are ultrasound including Doppler and nuclear medicine.","Radiologic evaluation of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation. - We describe the radiographic imaging modalities that were used in the first twelve consecutive patients who have undergone simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation (SPK) at our institution.

The Ranson and Glasgow criteria include a variety of simple laboratory parameters that are measured on admission and again within 48 h. They are the most widely used indices in clinical practice. The Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation II system is more complicated, but can be applied to a wide variety of conditions, especially in intensive care settings. The usefulness of this system depends on the threshold score for defining severe pancreatitis; a score of eight appears to be the most appropriate. The finding of nonperfused areas in the pancreas at contrast-enhanced computed tomography is indicative of pancreatic necrosis and portends an unfavourable prognosis. Other clinical and laboratory indices have been proposed, but the most important predictive factor of early mortality seems to be the presence and persistence of a Marshall organ failure score of two or more. This is especially true if organ dysfunction persists beyond 36 h. Radiological findings do not always correlate well with the presence of organ dysfunction, and more investigations are required.","Prognostic indicators in acute pancreatitis. - Several approaches have been used in an attempt to predict the severity and prognosis of attacks of acute pancreatitis.

Positive uptakes in the 18F-FDG PET scans were seen in 60 malignant tumours (54 metastasic lesions, six primary adrenal cancers) and seven benign tumours. The positive predictive value of 18F-FDG PET imaging to characterise an adrenal mass as a malignant tumour was 90%; the corresponding negative predictive value to rule out malignancy was also 90%. Benign adrenal tumours were smaller than that of malignant lesions (p<0.05). The mean standardised uptake value max (SUVmax) of the metastatic lesions [8.4+/-6.5 (microCi/g)/microCi/kg] was significantly higher than that of the benign adrenal tumours [2.4+/-1.2 (microCi/g)/microCi/kg, p<0.001]. Examination of only the primary adrenal lesions revealed that all adrenocortical carcinomas, two of three cases of pheochromocytomas, three of five neuroblastomas and two of four cases of primary aldosteronism showed positive 18F-FDG uptake.

We diagnosed as a recurrent pancreatic cancer of remnant pancreas without any other side of recurrence and re-resection was performed. Because of chylous ascites and depression following a second surgery, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy could not be started. Re-recurrence was detected at 3 months after the second surgery, and she died 6 months after the surgery. Remnant or repeated pancreatectomy for local recurrent pancreatic carcinomas is extremely rare with limited number of cases reported in the literature. We report our experience, and discuss the significance of re-resection for recurrence of remnant pancreas."

Regional 18F-DOPA utilization may be used to index dopaminergic abnormalities over time or dopaminergic response to treatment in clinical populations. Such studies require prior knowledge of the stability of the 18F-DOPA signal in the brain regions of interest. Test-retest reliability was examined in eight healthy volunteers who each received two 18F-DOPA PET scans, approximately 2 years apart. 18F-DOPA utilization (k(i)(cer)) was determined using graphical analysis relative to a reference tissue input (Patlak and Blasberg, 1985). Reproducibility (measured as the within-subjects variation) and reliability (measured as intraclass correlation coefficients, ICCs) of 18F-DOPA k(i)(cer) were assessed in the structural and functional subdivisions of the striatum and select extrastriatal brain regions. Voxel-based median ICC maps were used to visualize the distribution of 18F-DOPA k(i)(cer) reliability across the brain. The caudate and putamen, and associative and sensorimotor, striatal subdivisions showed good reliability across the two scan sessions with bilateral ICCs ranging from 0.681 to 0.944. Reliability was generally lower in extrastriatal regions, with bilateral ICCs ranging from 0.235 in the amygdala to 0.894 in the thalamus. These data confirm the utility of 18F-DOPA PET in assessing dopaminergic function in the striatum and select extrastriatal areas but highlight the limitations in using this approach to measure dopaminergic function in low uptake extrastriatal brain areas.

FDG PET can effectively differentiate pancreatic cancer from benign lesion with high accuracy. Newly-developed PET scanners can detect small pancreatic cancers, up to 7 mm in diameter, by their high resolution, which could make a great contribution to the early detection of resectable and potentially curable pancreatic cancers. FDG PET is useful and cost-beneficial in the pre-operative staging of pancreatic cancer because an unexpected distant metastasis can be detected by whole-body PET in about 40% of the cases, which results in avoidance of unnecessary surgical procedures. FDG PET is also useful in evaluation of the treatment effect, monitoring after the operation and detection of recurrent pancreatic cancers. However, there are some drawbacks in PET diagnosis. A relatively wide overlap has been reported between semiquantitative uptake values obtained in cancers and those in inflammatory lesions. As for false-positive cases, active and chronic pancreatitis and autoimmune pancreatitis sometimes show high FDG accumulation and mimic pancreatic cancer with a shape of focal uptake. There were 8 false negative cases in the detection of pancreatic cancer by FDG PET, up to 33 mm in diameter, mainly because of their poor cellularity in cancer tissues. In addition, there are 19% of cancer cases with a decline in FDG uptake from 1 hr to 2 hr scan. FDG PET was recently applied to and was shown to be feasible in the differential diagnosis of cystic pancreatic lesions, such as intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas.

The serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level was within normal limits, and intravenous pyelography and urethrocystography showed no abnormal findings. Because of his urinary retention, transurethral resection of prostate was performed under a clinical diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The pathological diagnosis was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Not only combination hormone therapy with goserelin acetate and flutamide, but also intermittent arterial infusion chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) and pirarubicin (THP) using a reservoir system was administered. Additionally total pelvic irradiation was delivered. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated that his prostate was reduced to less than 50% in size and he had no difficulty in voiding. He suddenly developed dysarthria and hemiplegia 3 months later. MRI and computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple brain metastases. After the gamma knife radiosurgery, neurological findings disappeared and MRI showed dramatic shrinkage of metastatic brain tumors.

The diagnostic criteria for pancreaticobiliary maljunction were proposed in 1987. The committee of The Japanese Study Group on Pancreaticobiliary Maljunction (JSGPM) for diagnostic criteria for pancreaticobiliary maljunction began to revise the diagnostic criteria from 2011 taking recently advanced diagnostic imaging techniques into consideration, and the final revised version was approved in the 36(th) Annual Meeting of JSPBM. For diagnosis of pancreaticobiliary maljunction, an abnormally long common channel and/or an abnormal union between the pancreatic and bile ducts must be evident on direct cholangiography, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, percutaneous transpehatic cholangiography, or intraoperative cholangiography; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; or three-dimensional drip infusion cholangiography computed tomography. However, in cases with a relatively short common channel, it is necessary to confirm that the effect of the papillary sphincter does not extend to the junction by direct cholangiography. Pancreaticobiliary maljunction can be diagnosed also by endoscopic ultrasonography or multi-planar reconstruction images provided by multi-detector row computed tomography. Elevated amylase levels in bile and extrahepatic bile duct dilatation strongly suggest the existence of pancreaticobiliary maljunction.","Diagnostic criteria for pancreaticobiliary maljunction 2013. - Pancreaticobiliary maljunction is a congenital malformation in which the pancreatic and bile ducts join anatomically outside the duodenal wall.

The aim of this study was to investigate regional haemodynamics in patients with cerebrovascular ischaemia by comparing the size of morphological defects (MD) and perfusion deficits (PD). Ninety patients with cerebrovascular disease were investigated and the size of morphological defects on computed tomography (CT) was compared to the size of perfusion deficits or the extent of exhausted cerebral perfusion reserve (CPR) on a combined flow-volume single photon emission tomographic (SPET) study. Carotid arteries were examined by Doppler ultrasonography. Defect/deficit size ratios of MD, PD and CPR were classified as: (1) CT/SPET mismatch: A (no MD or PD, reduced CPR), B (PD > MD); or (2) CT/SPET match: C (PD = MD). A CT/SPET mismatch was found in 79% of patients with a haemodynamic pattern and in 67% of transient ischaemic attack/reversible ischaemic neurological deficit patients who showed no MD. A mismatch was also found in 21% of patients with thromboembolic infarction. A match was found in 79% of the thromboembolic and in 16% of the haemodynamic infarctions. High grade (> 80%) stenosis of the internal carotid arteries was found in 81% of the mismatch cases, but in only 57% of the match cases. In conclusion, haemodynamic infarctions show a predominance of functional/morphological mismatch, a match being predominant in thromboembolic infarctions. Doppler failed to indicate disturbed intracerebral perfusion in nearly one-fifth of haemodynamically compromised patients. In addition to CT and Doppler, flow-volume SPET enables an assessment of intracerebral haemodynamics which might be relevant for prognosis and therapy.","Cerebral functional-morphological match or mismatch in cerebrovascular disease: a comparison of flow-volume SPET, CT findings and Doppler sonography. - Cerebral ischaemia (thromboembolic, haemodynamic) is usually classified according to morphological criteria, but intracerebral rheological aspects often remain underestimated, even though prognosis may depend on areas of reduced perfusion or perfusion reserve around a morphological defect. The aim of this study was to investigate regional haemodynamics in patients with cerebrovascular ischaemia by comparing the size of morphological defects (MD) and perfusion deficits (PD). Ninety patients with cerebrovascular disease were investigated and the size of morphological defects on computed tomography (CT) was compared to the size of perfusion deficits or the extent of exhausted cerebral perfusion reserve (CPR) on a combined flow-volume single photon emission tomographic (SPET) study. Carotid arteries were examined by Doppler ultrasonography. Defect/deficit size ratios of MD, PD and CPR were classified as: (1) CT/SPET mismatch: A (no MD or PD, reduced CPR), B (PD > MD); or (2) CT/SPET match: C (PD = MD). A CT/SPET mismatch was found in 79% of patients with a haemodynamic pattern and in 67% of transient ischaemic attack/reversible ischaemic neurological deficit patients who showed no MD. A mismatch was also found in 21% of patients with thromboembolic infarction. A match was found in 79% of the thromboembolic and in 16% of the haemodynamic infarctions. High grade (> 80%) stenosis of the internal carotid arteries was found in 81% of the mismatch cases, but in only 57% of the match cases. In conclusion, haemodynamic infarctions show a predominance of functional/morphological mismatch, a match being predominant in thromboembolic infarctions. Doppler failed to indicate disturbed intracerebral perfusion in nearly one-fifth of haemodynamically compromised patients. In addition to CT and Doppler, flow-volume SPET enables an assessment of intracerebral haemodynamics which might be relevant for prognosis and therapy."
122,CD009263,0,8786445,0,Complexity affects regional cerebral blood flow change during sequential finger movements.,"Brain regions activated with complex sequential finger movements were localized by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with positron emission tomography. Whereas the total number and frequency of finger movements were kept constant, the complexity of auditory cued sequential finger movements of the right hand varied, with sequence length as the independent variable. In four conditions of differing complexity, the bilateral primary sensorimotor area, left ventral premotor cortex, posterior supplementary motor area, right superior part of the cerebellum, and left putamen were consistently and equally activated. This finding suggests an executive role in running sequences, regardless of their length. The right dorsal premotor cortex (Brodmann area 6) and the right precuneus (Brodmann area 7) showed a linear increase of rCBF as sequence complexity increased. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that these areas function in the storage of motor sequences in spatial working memory and the production of ongoing sequential movement with reference to that of buffered memory. A similar increase in the cerebellar vermis and the left thalamus likewise suggests a role of these subcortical structures in complexity of sequential finger movements. Conversely, the left inferior parietal lobule showed a decrease of rCBF as complexity increased. Because short-term phonological storage is localized to this area, we suggest that the visuospatial working memory system may suppress other systems not in use. Our findings suggest that complex sequential finger movements recruit a discrete set of brain areas, in addition to areas underlying the execution of simple movement sequences.","Complexity affects regional cerebral blood flow change during sequential finger movements. - Brain regions activated with complex sequential finger movements were localized by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with positron emission tomography.

Pancreatic injuries are associated with significant mortality, primarily due to associated injuries, and pancreas-specific morbidity, especially in cases of delayed diagnosis. Early diagnosis of pancreatic trauma is a key for optimal management, but remains a challenge even with more advanced imaging modalities. For both penetrating and blunt pancreatic injuries, the presence of main pancreatic ductal injury is the major determinant of morbidity and the major factor guiding management decisions. For main pancreatic ductal injury, surgery remains the preferred approach with distal pancreatectomy for most injuries and more conservative surgical management for proximal ductal injuries involving the head of the pancreas. More recently, nonoperative management has been utilized, especially in the pediatric population, with the potential for increased rates of pseudocyst and pancreatic fistulae and the potential for the need for further intervention and increased hospital stay.

We have used a defined treatment protocol in these difficult cases. The experiences gained are reported here. Patients with clinical signs of ongoing bleeding and with hemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst in ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) were studied with urgent angiography. Patients showing a pseudoaneurysm were treated with immediate embolization and delayed elective surgery whenever candidates for surgery. During a 5-year period 10 patients were treated according to the protocol. Pseudoaneurysm was demonstrated and subsequent embolization performed in six. Angiography was negative in four patients. During the study period two additional patients were treated conservatively without angiography because the bleeding had stopped 2 weeks prior to the referral to our institution. Two patients were electively operated on and the remaining 10 patients were treated conservatively. Fever and elevated transaminases developed in one of the six patients after the embolotherapy. One of the four embolized patients who were not operated on developed pseudocyst infection 4 months after the embolization. One of the 10 conservatively treated patients died (1/10 = 10%; total mortality, 1/12 = 8%) during the follow-up for infection complications of necrotizing pancreatitis 2 months after the initial bleeding.

The p56lck gene expression was also investigated in selected cases. The expression pattern of CD45 RA/RO antigen was defined as of RA, mixed, or RO type. All but one CD7+ CD5- CD2- case were of the RA type. The CD7+ CD5+ CD2- prothymic stage included seven RA and one mixed type cases. One CD7+ CD5- CD2+ case was of the RA type, but the other was of the RO type. The CD7+ CD5+ CD2+ prothymic stage included three RA and four mixed type cases. All seven CD3- CD4+ CD8+ (double-positive) thymic cases were of the RO type. The CD3+ CD4+ CD8+ (triple-positive) stage included two RO and three mixed-type cases.

The expression of p56lck gene in the prothymic stage was less marked than that in the thymic stage. On the basis of these results, the following sequence of pattern of the CD45 RA/RO antigen expression along with T-lineage differentiation was reconstructed: prothymic stage [RA and mixed type]-->double-positive thymic stage [RO type]-->triple-positive thymic stage [RO and mixed type]-->peripheral stage [RA, mixed, and RO type]. While one RO-type CD7+ CD5- CD2- and one RO-type CD7+ CD5- CD2+ cases were not in accord with this sequence, the pattern of CD45 RA/RO antigen expression in most of T-lineage neoplasms could be determined by the respective stage of differentiation. The poor expression of the p56lck gene by the prothymic blasts compared with the thymic blasts may be related to the expression pattern of the CD45 RA/RO molecules, which exhibits phosphatase activity. The consistent RO-type expression in the ATL cases may reflect the activated status of the neoplastic T cells due to the presence of the HTLV-I gene.

Twenty-eight adult patients with known or suspected pancreatic tumours were examined. Pre- and post-gadolinium (GdDTPA-BMA) scans were obtained in combination with an oral negative contrast medium (ferristene) to mark the gastrointestinal tract. In 6 cases a more precise diagnosis could be made by dynamic MRI compared to unenhanced MRI. Surgery could confirm the MR diagnosis based on contrast enhancement in 83% compared to 78% for CT. The results of signal intensity (SI) measurements show that a combination of differences in baseline values before enhancement and the slope of enhancement within the first 20 s is a reliable criterion to distinguish between normal pancreas and hypovascular tumours. These tumours already show lower SI values before as well as lower slopes after early enhancement. Mainly two effects facilitate the final MRI diagnosis: (1) the delineation of the pancreas from the duodenum by the negative contrast medium, and (2) the enhancement pattern of pancreatic tumours by gadolinium-enhanced dynamic MRI compared to normal tissue within the early enhancement after contrast injection.","Dynamic fast-gradient echo MR imaging of pancreatic tumours. - The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic utility of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas.

However, accurate tumor staging can be obtained only after resection, and still there is a great difference in survival rates among patients with the same clinicopathologic parameters. Recently the uptake of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) by positron emission tomography (PET) has been found to be correlated with survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. This study evaluated the role of 18FDG PET as a prognostic factor for patients with pancreatic cancer. From June 1996 to July 2002, a total of 118 patients underwent PET for pancreatic cancer. The standardized uptake value (SUV) of 18FDG was calculated in 60 of them, and these patients were divided into high (>4) and low (< or =4) SUV groups. They were also evaluated according to the tumor node metastasis (TNM) classification system of the International Union Against Cancer, and by tumor grade, medical or surgical treatment, diabetes, age, sex, and CA 19-9 serum levels. Twenty-nine cancers showed high and 31 showed low SUVs. Survival was significantly influenced by tumor stage (P=0.0001), tumor grade (P=0.01), and SUV (P=0.005). Multivariate analysis showed that only stage (P=0.001) and SUV (P=0.0002) were independent predictors of survival.

The question remains how to verify access to the brain. Early imaging studies including micro-PET can help to overcome this. However, in case of delayed tracer development or because of no feasible application of brain imaging effects of the molecule, using CSF as a matrix could fill this gap. Proteomic research using CSF will hopefully have a major impact on the development of treatments for psychiatric disorders.","Biomarkers in psychotropic drug development: integration of data across multiple domains. - This review focuses on the current status of biomarkers and/or approaches critical to assessing novel neuroscience targets with an emphasis on new paradigms and challenges in this field of research.

For detection of pancreatic disease, the best tests were the pancreatic-function test (cholecystokinin-stimulated enzyme outputs) and ultrasonography. The pancreatic scan was nonspecific (P less than 0.001), and thermography was insensitive (P less than 0.001). Endoscopic retrograde pancreatography and arteriography were significantly more sensitive than cytologic study in diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (P less than 0.001). Therefore, when pancreatic cancer is suspected, abdominal ultrasound should be performed first, and if it is negative, a pancreatic-function test next.

We performed a prospective longitudinal observational study on 76 patients with pancreatic masses: 57 (75%) patients with solid pancreatic tumors and 19 (25%) patients with cystic and mixed pancreatic masses. For each tumor the CEUS and CECT features were analyzed and compared with the final histological diagnosis. RESULTS.

The accumulation of urban contaminants in stormwater ponds can lead to a number of water quality problems including high nutrient, chemical contaminant, and bacterial levels. This study examined the interaction between land use and coastal pond water quality in a South Carolina residential subdivision pond. Eutrophic levels of chlorophyll and phosphorus were present in all seasons. Harmful cyanobacterial blooms were prevalent during the summer months. Microcystin toxin and fecal coliform bacteria levels were measured that exceeded health and safety standards. Low concentrations of herbicides (atrazine and 2,4-D) were also detected during summer months. Drainage from the stormwater pond may transport contaminants into the adjacent tidal creek and estuary. A survey of residents within the pond's watershed indicated poor pet waste management and frequent use of fertilizers and pesticides as possible contamination sources.

The accumulation of urban contaminants in stormwater ponds can lead to a number of water quality problems including high nutrient, chemical contaminant, and bacterial levels. This study examined the interaction between land use and coastal pond water quality in a South Carolina residential subdivision pond. Eutrophic levels of chlorophyll and phosphorus were present in all seasons. Harmful cyanobacterial blooms were prevalent during the summer months. Microcystin toxin and fecal coliform bacteria levels were measured that exceeded health and safety standards. Low concentrations of herbicides (atrazine and 2,4-D) were also detected during summer months. Drainage from the stormwater pond may transport contaminants into the adjacent tidal creek and estuary. A survey of residents within the pond's watershed indicated poor pet waste management and frequent use of fertilizers and pesticides as possible contamination sources. Educational and outreach activities were provided to community members to create an awareness of the water quality conditions in the pond. Pond management strategies were then recommended, and selected mitigation actions were implemented.

Sixty seven patients had malignant disease and 16 benign disease. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic efficiency of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology in detecting malignancy were 91%, 100%, 100%, 73%, and 93%, respectively. In solid pancreatic masses the sensitivity of FNA cytology rose to 98%, while in cystic pancreatic masses sensitivity fell to 62%. In 18 patients with cystic lesions (12 benign and 6 malignant), the cystic fluid was analyzed for amylase, CEA and CA 19-9 content. Amylase levels were high in pseudocysts and in 4/6 malignant cysts. CEA levels were low in benign cysts, and high in all malignant cysts. CA 19-9 levels were high in one pseudocyst and in all malignant cysts. Tumour marker content analysis enhanced the sensitivity of the cytologic diagnosis of malignant cysts to 92%. FNA cytology is a simple and highly accurate method in the differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic lesions.

Currently, noninvasive and repetitive monitoring of islet engraftment and function is an emerging and promising modality for successful islet transplantation. Here we report a new technique for highly sensitive in vivo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of transplanted pancreatic islets. To this end, heparinized superparamagnetic iron oxide (heparin-SPIO) nanoparticle was newly synthesized for chemical conjugation onto islet surface. Compared to typical cellular labeling of Feridex(®) via random endocytosis, chemical conjugation of heparin-SPIO was stable and improved the hypointensity of transplanted islets due to surface modification of every islet. These heparin-SPIO-conjugated islets showed normal viability and insulin secretion, and were quantified by spin echo T(2)-weighted MR imaging with linear correlation depending on transplanted islet mass in vitro and in vivo for 30 days. Also, from the immunohistochemistry, we confirmed the existence of heparin-SPIO and insulin biosynthesis in transplanted islets. However, Feridex-uptake islets showed late glucose responsiveness according to changing glucose concentration although they could normally control the blood glucose levels in diabetic mouse. Thus, we anticipate that this surface labeling with heparin-SPIO can be directly applicable for MR imaging of transplanted islets.","MRI of transplanted surface-labeled pancreatic islets with heparinized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. - Transplantation of insulin-secreting pancreatic islets can provide real-time regulation of blood glucose in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

The breakpoints of the t(2;5) (p23;q35) [corrected] translocation, which is reported in about 40% of Ki-1 ALCL, have recently been cloned. They involve a novel tyrosine kinase gene, ALK, at 2p23 and the nucleophosmin gene, NPM, at 5q35. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using NPM and ALK primers consistently detects a fusion product in Ki-1 ALCL cases with the translocation. To determine if this tumor-specific genetic alteration also occurs in HD, we performed NPM-ALK RT-PCR on RNA samples extracted from 40 lymph node biopsies of HD (25 nodular sclerosis, 11 mixed cellularity, 2 lymphocyte depleted, 2 lymphocyte predominant). Using control samples, the sensitivity of the NPM-ALK RT-PCR assay was shown to be at least 1:10(4). Amplifiable template was confirmed in all samples by RT-PCR using beta-actin primers. None of the 40 cases showed the expected 177-bp RT-PCR product indicative of the translocation. We conclude that the most common primary genetic alteration in Ki-1 ALCL, the t(2;5), is absent or very infrequent in typical cases of HD. These results further support the concept that HD and Ki-1 ALCL are pathogenetically distinct entities.","Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the Ki-1 anaplastic large cell lymphoma-associated t(2;5) translocation in Hodgkin's disease. - Hodgkin's disease (HD) and Ki-1 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (Ki-1 ALCL) appear pathologically and immunohistochemically related, and a common histogenesis has been postulated in at least some cases.

We have compared the usual methods of prognostic evaluation (computed tomography CT and the Ranson clinical score scale) with the scintigraphic findings in 23 consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild or severe acute pancreatitis. All 6 patients with severe pancreatitis showed an uptake which was mostly mild. 9/17 patients with mild pancreatitis showed uptake, which also frequently had a low intensity. When the severity index of CT was compared with the leukocyte results, the only patient with a high severity index showed a grade 3 uptake. However, in over 50% of the patients with a low severity index, uptake, generally having a low intensity, was found. When the uptake degree was compared with the Ranson score level, we observed a predominance of mild uptake in both patients with mild and severe pancreatitis. Considering these results, we believe that the lack of uptake in the leukocyte study in a patient with acute pancreatitis can be interpreted as a good prognosis sign.

230,CD010213,0,21141249,0,Managing acute and chronic pancreatitis.,"Pancreatitis may be acute or chronic. Although both can be caused by similar aetiologies, they tend to follow distinct natural histories. Around 80% of acute pancreatitis (AP) diagnoses occur secondary to gallstone disease and alcohol misuse. AP is commonly associated with sudden onset of upper abdominal pain radiating to the back that is usually severe enough to warrant the patient seeking urgent medical attention. Onset of pain may be related to a recent alcohol binge or rich, fatty meal. The patient may appear unwell, be tachycardic and have exquisite tenderness in the upper abdomen. Overall, 10-25% of AP episodes are classified as severe, leading to an associated mortality rate of 7.5%. Disease severity is best predicted from a number of clinical scoring systems which can be applied at diagnosis in association with repeated clinical assessment, measurement of acute inflammatory markers, and CT. All patients with suspected AP should be referred urgently. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) follows continued, repetitive or sustained injury to the pancreas and 70% of diagnoses occur secondary to alcohol abuse. The characteristic presenting feature of CP is insidious progression of chronic, severe, upper abdominal pain, radiating to the back, caused by a combination of progressive pancreatic destruction, inflammation and duct obstruction. Signs and symptoms include weight loss and steatorrhoea and later on diabetes. CP patients may also present with recurrent episodes mimicking AP, both symptomatically and metabolically. Diagnosis of CP should be based on symptom profile, imaging and assessment of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic function. CT should be the first-line imaging investigation.","Managing acute and chronic pancreatitis. - Pancreatitis may be acute or chronic.

Two different tracers were used [beta-11C]L-DOPA for decarboxylase activity during the in vivo synthesis of dopamine, and [11C]nomifensine to estimate the number of terminals. Although there was a slight increase in the rate of dopamine synthesis in the putamen after the exposure, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.4). No effect was observed with regard to the uptake of nomifensine. There was no significant relationship between the dose of toluene and rate of dopamine synthesis, and no significant correlation between the time from end of exposure to start of the PET-camera and DOPA.

Technical innovations in MR imaging have evolved over the last decade, with most sequences being performed in one or a few breath-holds. Three-dimensional sequences with thin, contiguous slices allow for improved spatial resolution on the postgadolinium images and MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The diagnostic potential of MRCP is equivalent to endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, particularly when intravenous secretin is used to enhance the pancreatic duct assessment.

Positron emission tomography (PET) using the radiolabeled glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been suggested to provide excellent accuracy for noninvasive determination of suspicious pancreatic masses. We conducted a prospective study to verify these results. Forty-two patients admitted for pancreatic surgery underwent PET scanning. Image analysis was based on visual film evaluation and quantification of regional tracer uptake. PET imaging was visually analyzed by three observers blinded for the results of other diagnostic tests; they qualitatively graded the scans using a five-point scale (I = low to V = high) for the presence and intensity of focal FDG uptake. Diagnosis was proven by histology (n = 38) or follow-up (n = 4). Furthermore, the results of PET were compared with helical computed tomography (CT) and conventional ultrasonography (US), done during the routine diagnostic workup before pancreatic cancer surgery. Regarding only the results with scores of IV and V as positive for representing definite malignancy yielded a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 64% for film reading. Quantification of regional tracer uptake contributed no significant diagnostic advantage for differentiation between benign and malignant tumors. Helical CT revealed a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 45.5% and abdominal US 56% and 50%, respectively. We concluded that PET imaging provides only fair diagnostic accuracy (69%) for characterizing enlarged pancreatic masses. PET does not allow exclusion of malignant tumors. In doubtful cases, the method must be combined with other imaging modalities, such as helical CT. The results indicate that the number of invasive procedures is not significantly reduced by PET imaging.","Preoperative evaluation of pancreatic masses with positron emission tomography using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose: diagnostic limitations. - Identification of pancreatic cancer in patients presenting with an enlarged pancreatic mass is a major diagnostic problem.

T., Nobre, A. C. Where and when to pay attention: the neural systems for directing attention to spatial locations and to time intervals as revealed by both PET and fMRI. Journal of Neuroscience, 1998, 18, 7426-7435]. In the present experiment, we explored the behavioural and anatomical correlates of temporal orienting to foveal visual stimuli, in order to eliminate any spatial attention confounds. We implemented a two-way factorial design in an event-related fMRI study to examine the factors of trial validity (predictability of target by cue), length of delay (cue-target interval), and their interaction. There were two distinct types of invalid trial: those where attention was automatically drawn to a premature target and those where attention was voluntarily shifted to a delayed time-point. Reaction times for valid trials were shorter than those for invalid trials, demonstrating appropriate allocation of attention to temporal cues. All trial-types activated a shared system, including frontoparietal areas bilaterally, showing that this network is consistently associated with attentional orienting and is not specific to spatial tasks. Distinct brain areas were sensitive to cue-target delays and to trial validity. Long cue-target intervals activated areas involved in motor preparation: supplementary motor cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus. Invalid trials, where temporal expectancies were breached, showed enhanced activation of left parietal and frontal areas, and engagement of orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally. Finally, trial validity interacted with length of delay. Appearance of targets prematurely selectively activated visual extrastriate cortex; while postponement of target appearance selectively activated right prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that distinct brain areas are involved in redirecting attention based upon sensory events (bottom-up, exogenous shifts) and based upon cognitive expectations (top-down, endogenous shifts).","Orienting attention in time: behavioural and neuroanatomical distinction between exogenous and endogenous shifts. - Temporal orienting of attention is the ability to focus resources at a particular moment in time in order to optimise behaviour, and is associated with activation of left parietal and premotor cortex [Coull, J.

The prognostic importance of certain pathological factors in relation to survival was also evaluated. As regards the site of origin, 112 cases with carcinoma were classified as follows: 56 pancreatic, 32 ampullary, 10 common bile duct, and 14 undefined. Papillary tumors were more accurately defined by ERCP compared to CT+US (p = 0.033), whereas CT was less accurate than US+ERCP (p = 0.05). No significant differences were found in pancreatic and common bile duct tumors. Pathological confirmation was obtained with ERCP in 54 cases (46% pancreatic, 69% papillary and 50% common bile duct). In the remaining 58 patients (including 1 chronic pancreatitis) the diagnosis was confirmed with percutaneous or intraoperative biopsy. Tumor extent was better defined by US+CT. In 42 resected patients the final pathological examination revealed an error of preoperative staging in 79% pancreatic, 59% papillary, and 83% common bile duct tumors.

Organs examined were the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, ampulla, pancreas, common bile duct, and gallbladder. There were 18 staging exams of known neoplasms, and 24 examinations to evaluate possible mass. Forty-three examinations were successful, four failed due to instrument malfunction, and three were technical failures. Among 35 exams for masses, follow-up pathology was available in 21 and confirmed EUS findings in 90%. EUS yielded additional information, not available by other imaging studies, in 60% of successful exams. No complications were seen. The recent literature is reviewed in approximately 2000 patients.

278,CD010409,0,11351245,0,Expression of Fas ligand in gastric carcinoma relates to lymph node metastasis.,"Tumors may escape a host's immune response by means of various mechanisms. The Fas (CD95/APO-1)/Fas ligand (FasL) system is one of the major apoptotic pathways. Recently, it has been reported that tumor cells can express FasL, induce apoptosis in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and thus can escape host immune surveillance. In gastric carcinoma, tumor progression by way of the lymphatics is often seen, and lymph node metastasis is a critical factor influencing the recurrence of cancer and its prognosis. We, therefore, investigated the relationship between the expression of FasL and the lymphatic spread of gastric carcinoma. FasL-expression was examined by an immunohistochemical method using 100 surgically resected gastric carcinomas and 55 metastatic lymph nodes. Apoptotic cells among tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes were detected by T lymphocyte staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method in a series of sections of metastatic lymph nodes. FasL-expression was detected in 86% of primary lesions and 71% of metastatic lymph nodes. In cases with high levels of FasL-expression, the observed expression of lymph node metastases was significant (p=0.047). Moreover, FasL-positive cases with both primary lesions and metastatic lymph nodes showed also distant lymph node metastasis beyond the regional lymph nodes (p=0.030). Apoptosis among tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes was more frequently seen in FasL-positive lesions (p=0.057). Furthermore, patients with FasL-negative primary lesions tended to exhibit longer survival times than patients with FasL-positive primary lesions. The results suggest tumor escape through the lymphatic pathway via FasL-expression in gastric carcinomas.","Expression of Fas ligand in gastric carcinoma relates to lymph node metastasis. - Tumors may escape a host's immune response by means of various mechanisms.

This instrument makes possible endoscopic visualization of the UGI tract and, at the same one time, allows us to do ultrasonic scanning of internal organs in the neighbourhood of the UGI tract.

Endoscopic ultrasonography using the equipment type III is useful as a new diagnostic tool of great value in gastroenterology. However, there still remain a few mechanical points to be improved. It is desired that the rigid section of the tip of the endoscope is shortened more and the stability of the endoscopic image is guaranteed.

She died 3 weeks after discharge. CT-guided splanchnic nerve block may be useful in cases of insufficient pain relief after fluoroscopy-guided splanchnic nerve block."

The patient was sent from a peripheral medical center, presenting with jaundice, pruritus, weight loss, and hyperglycemia of 20 days' duration. At admission, the patient was icteric, choluric, and acholic. His abdomen was soft and nontender, and the patient felt no pain in his abdomen. He had skin lesions because of scratching. Laboratory findings showed a blood glucose level of 135 mg%; total serum bilirubin, 29.4 mg%; direct bilirubin, 23 mg%; and alkaline phosphatase, 1100 IU/L. Abdominal ultrasound showed an enlarged head of the pancreas that was 30 x 35 mm. The parenchyma was slightly heterogeneous. Abdominal computed tomography showed an enlarged head of the pancreas with a normal body and tail, thickened duodenal wall, and dilated intra- and extrahepatic biliary tract, and the distal choledochus was not visible. Magnetic resonance imaging showed dilated intra- and extrahepatic biliary tract. The choledochus was not visible, and the cystic duct ended abruptly. The pancreas head was enlarged and homogenous, and there were no changes with contrast. Wirsung's duct was not dilated. Laparotomy was performed with a presumed diagnosis of pancreatic head tumor. The pancreas was diffusely indurated and enlarged; biopsy and intraoperative cholangiography were performed. The biliary tract was dilated with no duodenal passage of contrast, and the Wirsung's duct was not observed. Cholecystectomy was performed, and a transcystic drain was positioned. The histopathology was compatible with autoimmune pancreatitis. Prednisone treatment was started with good response. Autoimmune pancreatitis is a very rare entity among children and adolescents.

All patients underwent surgery at our department and had a complete histologic workup. We then related the preoperative findings to the intraoperative and histologic findings and analyzed the advantages and limitations of PET in comparison with conventional diagnostic techniques. Both CT and PET showed high sensitivities (82% and 84%, respectively) but rather low specificities (61%). ERCP showed good specificity at 83% but weak sensitivity at 46%. The positive predictive value was higher than 80% for all methods, whereas the negative predictive value was around 60% at best. Both the CT and the PET diagnoses were wrong in 15% of the cases. In all cases with a false CT diagnosis, the results of the other conventional examinations provided sufficient evidence to indicate the need for surgical intervention.

352,CD010409,0,2103863,0,The immunohistology of lymph nodes in HIV infection: a review.,"Most available evidence indicates that lymph node immunohistologic alterations in HIV-infected patients represent a dynamic process characterized by an initial florid follicular hyperplasia that ultimately progresses to a burned-out, lymphocyte depletion end-point. During this process, HIV-infected cells appear to traffic through the lymph node, and the germinal center serves as a reservoir relatively rich in HIV antigens and intact virus. The localization of HIV within the germinal center may provide one stimulus for the florid follicular hyperplasia typical of early HIV-related lymphadenopathy and may play a role in follicle lysis, a process whereby the accessory cell FDC network of follicles undergoes disruption, which may in turn be responsible for the eventual disappearance of B-cell follicles in late-stage disease. Lymph node CD4+ T cells are selectively depleted with an initial preferential loss of the CD4+ subset concerned with B-cell differentiation. The expression of the CD4 antigen by various other cell types including monocytes, macrophages, histiocytic dendritic cells, and FDC provides one explanation as to why these cells are subject to HIV infection. Except perhaps in end-stage disease, alterations among various lymph node cell subsets do not correlate well with those in the peripheral blood. The latter is therefore regarded as a more sensitive parameter of progressive immunologic changes in HIV infection.","The immunohistology of lymph nodes in HIV infection: a review. - Most available evidence indicates that lymph node immunohistologic alterations in HIV-infected patients represent a dynamic process characterized by an initial florid follicular hyperplasia that ultimately progresses to a burned-out, lymphocyte depletion end-point.

374,CD010213,0,12833599,0,Preoperative chemoradiation and pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein resection for localized advanced pancreatic cancer.,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a common disease that is rarely cured. Surgical resection remains the only treatment modality that has a curative potential, although the majority of patients are unsuitable for resection at the time of diagnosis. Chemoradiation therapy prior to a pancreaticoduodenectomy ensures that a patient who undergoes a complete resection multimodality therapy, avoids a resection in patients who have a rapidly progressive disease, and allows radiation therapy to be given to well oxygenated cells before, surgical devasculation. This permits the chance of resection of an unresectable pancreatic cancer by downstaging. A patient with cytologic proof of localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head received an intravenously chemoradiation (Taxol, 50 mg/m2 intravenously for 3 hours week on 5 cycles, of Gemcytabine 1000 mg/m2/day intravenously for 3 days week on 2 cycles, of 4500 cGy) with the intention of proceeding to a resection operation, restaging was performed by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging from 5 weeks every months due to ongoing decreasing of tumor size after the chemoradiation. At laparotomy, the patient didn't have suspected metastatic disease, the tumor size was 2 X 3 cm on the pancreas head and was infiltrating into the portal vein for about 3 cm length on right side. A pancreaticoduodenectomy along with a portal vein and superior mesenteric vein resection was done and then reconstruction of a vascular anastomosis by using the right side of the internal jugular vein. Perioperative complications didn't occur. In conclusion, preoperative chemoradiation of a localized advanced pancreatic tumor has no added risk to the operative complications and the prospects for resectability are enhanced.","Preoperative chemoradiation and pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein resection for localized advanced pancreatic cancer. - Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a common disease that is rarely cured.

The largest mean diameter was 8.9 cm for 10 malignant cases, 5.0 cm for two premalignant cases, and 3.1 cm for eight benign tumours. Ultrasonography or computed tomography or both, corresponded well with macroscopy. The 10 malignant and two premalignant lesions had intracystic mural nodules or extracystic solid components, while the eight benign specimens had neither nodules nor solid portions. Structural complexity seen on ultrasonography or computed tomography, which reflected the irregularity in size and shape of the cysts, internal septa, walls, and solid components, was severe in the 10 malignant and two borderline tumours and mild or moderate in the eight benign lesions. Angiography showed that five of the nine malignant tumours were hypervascular, while the two premalignant and four benign lesions were all avascular. Five of 10 patients with malignant tumours died of local recurrence or remote hematogenous metastases, and one with malignant disease was still alive with liver metastases at the time of writing. We propose that a careful preoperative estimate of the malignant potential of such cysts should be made based on the size of the tumour, the presence of mural nodules and solid areas, and the structural complexity on ultrasonography or computed tomography, as well as the amount of vascularity seen on angiography.

Pancreatic cancer progresses rapidly, with only 1% of patients surviving more than 5 years after diagnosis. However, if the disease is diagnosed when it is localized, the 5-year survival is approximately 20%. It would be beneficial to detect breast cancer and pancreatic cancer at the earliest possible stage, when multimodal therapy with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have the greatest chance of prolonging survival. Human estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells typically display elevated levels of Myc protein due to overexpression of MYC mRNA, elevated cyclin D1 protein due to overexpression of CCND1 mRNA, and elevated insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) due to overexpression of IGF1R mRNA. We hypothesized that scintigraphic detection of MYC or CCND1 peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes with an IGF1 peptide loop on the C-terminus, and a Tc-99m-chelator peptide on the N-terminus, could measure levels of MYC or CCND1 mRNA noninvasively in human IGF1R-overexpressing MCF7 breast cancer xenografts in immunocompromised mice. Similarly, human pancreatic cancer cells typically display elevated levels of KRAS mRNA and elevated IGF1R. Hence, we also hypothesized that a KRAS Tc-99m-chelator PNA-peptide probe could detect overexpression of KRAS mRNA in pancreatic cancer xenografts by scintigraphic imaging, or by positron emission tomography (PET) with a KRAS Cu-64-chelator PNA-peptide. Human MCF7 breast cancer xenografts in immunocompromised mice were imaged scintigraphically 4-24 h after tail-vein administration of MYC or CCND1 Tc-99m-chelator PNA-peptides, but not after administration of mismatch controls. Similarly, human Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells xenografts were imaged scintigraphically 4 and 24 h after tail-vein administration of a KRAS Tc-99m-chelator PNA-peptide, and AsPC1 xenografts were imaged by PET 4 and 24 h after tail-vein adminstration of a KRAS Cu-64-chelator PNA-peptide.

To further decrease the mortality rate of SAP, it is important to precisely evaluate the severity at an early stage, and initiate appropriate treatment as early as possible.

Severity can be evaluated by laboratory examinations or by clinical signs, reducing the defect values of the severity factors. Moreover, the severity criteria considered laboratory/clinical severity scores and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) findings as independent risk factors. Thus, CE-CT scans are not necessarily required to evaluate the severity of acute pancreatitis. There was no fatal case in mild AP diagnosed by the CE-CT severity score, whereas case-mortality rate in those with SAP was 14.8%. Case-mortality of SAP that fulfilled both the laboratory/clinical and the CE-CT severity criteria was 30.8%. It is recommended, therefore, to perform CE-CT examination to clarify the prognosis in those patients who were diagnosed as SAP by laboratory/clinical severity criteria.

Longitudinal FDOPA-positron emission tomography (PET) assessment in Amp-treated subjects subsequently revealed a gradual recovery of striatal dopamine function: FDOPA Ki values were decreased by approximately 70% at 1 month, approximately 45% at 6 months, approximately 20% at 12 months and were similar to pre-Amp values at 24 months. Motoric and social behavioral measures were obtained on all subjects within a species-typical group setting. Behavioral observations were conducted during both basal and stressor-challenge conditions, the latter being created by placing a potential intruder-animal in an individual cage adjacent to the subject's group enclosure. During basal conditions, post-Amp stereotypies were present at 2 weeks and locomotor behaviors were increased throughout 1 month; both alterations occurred while FDOPA Ki values were significantly decreased. Social behaviors were also significantly affected; affiliative behavior was decreased up to 6 months while aggressive behavior was increased for 12 months. However, a different pattern of behavioral changes emerged under stressor-challenge conditions. Motoric and social changes were of greater magnitude and persisted longer than in basal settings while aggressive behavior remained elevated at 24 months. These results indicate that chronic Amp-induced decreases in FDOPA Ki values and behavioral alterations are reversible. Changes in striatal dopamine function as indexed with FDOPA-PET are not correlated with post-Amp alterations in behaviors and moreover, expression of those behaviors is context-dependent.","Ethological and 6-[18F]fluoro-L-DOPA-PET profiles of long-term vulnerability to chronic amphetamine. - A chronic 10-day amphetamine (Amp) protocol was used to induce significant long-term decrements of the striatal [18F]fluoro-L-DOPA influx rate constant (FDOPA Ki) in the vervet monkey.

Although a well-organized protocol for the treatment of venous thrombosis has not been established, anticoagulation therapy is commonly recommended. A 73-year-old man was diagnosed with acute progressive portal vein thrombosis associated with acute pancreatitis. After one month of anticoagulation therapy, the patient developed severe hematemesis. With endoscopy and an abdominal computed tomography scan, hemorrhages in the pancreatic pseudocyst, which was ruptured into the duodenal bulb, were confirmed. After conservative treatment, the patient was stabilized. While the rupture of a pseudocyst into the surrounding viscera is a well-known phenomenon, spontaneous rupture into the duodenum is rare. Moreover, no reports of upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by pseudocyst rupture in patients under anticoagulation therapy for venous thrombosis associated with acute pancreatitis have been published.

459,CD009263,0,14762700,1,Endocrine disruptors in bottled mineral water: estrogenic activity in the E-Screen.,"Human exposure to endocrine disruptors is well documented by biomonitoring data. However, this information is limited to few chemicals like bisphenol A or phthalate plasticizers. To account for so-far unidentified endocrine disruptors and potential mixture effects we employ bioassays to detect endocrine activity in foodstuff and consequently characterize the integrated exposure to endocrine active compounds. Recently, we reported a broad contamination of commercially available bottled water with estrogenic activity and presented evidence for the plastic packaging being a source of this contamination. In continuation of that work, we here compare different sample preparation methods to extract estrogen-like compounds from bottled water. These data demonstrate that inappropriate extraction methods and sample treatment may lead to false-negative results when testing water extracts in bioassays. Using an optimized sample preparation strategy, we furthermore present data on the estrogenic activity of bottled water from France, Germany, and Italy: eleven of the 18 analyzed water samples (61.1%) induced a significant estrogenic response in a bioassay employing a human carcinoma cell line (MCF7, E-Screen). The relative proliferative effects ranged from 19.8 to 50.2% corresponding to an estrogenic activity of 1.9-12.2 pg estradiol equivalents per liter bottled water. When comparing water of the same spring that is packed in glass or plastic bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), estrogenic activity is three times higher in water from plastic bottles. These data support the hypothesis that PET packaging materials are a source of estrogen-like compounds. Furthermore, the findings presented here conform to previous studies and indicate that the contamination of bottled water with endocrine disruptors is a transnational phenomenon.","Endocrine disruptors in bottled mineral water: estrogenic activity in the E-Screen. - Human exposure to endocrine disruptors is well documented by biomonitoring data.

Methylphenidate is marketed as a racemic mixture of the d-threo and l-threo enantiomers. It is believed that the d enantiomer is responsible for the therapeutic effect of methylphenidate. In this study we labeled the individual enantiomers with carbon-11 and compared their binding and pharmacokinetics in the human and baboon brain.

They had been studied prospectively using ultrasonography, computerized tomography, radionuclide scanning, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), selective celiac and superior mesenteric angiography, duodenal drainage studies, cytologic studies, serum carcinoembryonic antigen assay, and pancreatic oncofetal antigen assay, The results were compared to determine which test would most frequently and reliably differentiate between pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis in a patient believed to have one or other disease. Criteria for interpreting results, first for highest rate of correct diagnoses, and second for highest accuracy were derived. Applying these criteria, ultrasonography achieved the highest rate of correct diagnoses (97% of patients diagnosed with 84% accuracy). ERCP, duodenal drainage studies, and cytology were the most accurate tests ((86% accuracy each test) but, with this accuracy, ERCP most frequently gave a diagnosis (diagnosis rate: ERCP--70%, duodenal drainage--32%, cytology--35%). The results suggest that ultrasonography is the best noninvasive test, and that a combination of ERCP, pancreatic juice assay and cytology in a single procedure may prove to be the best discriminating investigation.","Non-operative differentiation between pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. - Eighty-five of 186 patients investigated for suspected pancreatic cancer had an unequivocal final diagnosis of either pancreatic cancer (58 patients) or chronic pancreatitis (27 patients).

Using a pattern recognition method, two main clusters were recognized within the germinal centers of HIV and FH lymph nodes on the basis of the relative frequencies of small centroblast and centrocytes. All FH lymph nodes and 6 HIV-1 lymph nodes (HIV-Clu-1) were placed in cluster 1; 9 HIV-1 lymph nodes (HIV-Clu-2) formed cluster 2. Germinal centers in the HIV-Clu-2 lymph nodes were characterized by a cell composition of predominantly lymphoid blasts and decreased numbers of centrocytes, but without altered numbers of mitotic figures. The frequency distribution of ultrastructurally distinct FDC subtypes differed between these clusters. In HIV-Clu-2 the frequencies of FDC types with an undifferentiated and regressive morphology occurred at a higher frequency, whereas FDC types with a highly differentiated morphology had a lower frequency. We conclude that 9 out of 15 lymph nodes with HIV-1 associated follicular hyperplasia show changes in FDC morphology indicative of a less differentiated functional stage of FDC. The changes in FDC morphology are closely associated with changes in the germinal center B-cell population resulting in an inverted blast to the centrocyte ratio.","Cellular composition of germinal centers in lymph nodes after HIV-1 infection: evidence for an inadequate support of germinal center B lymphocytes by follicular dendritic cells. - Germinal centers in lymph nodes with follicular hyperplasia from 15 patients with HIV-1 infection were analyzed by qualitative and quantitative electron microscopical methods and compared with control follicular hyperplasia (FH).

In the paradigm most commonly used to address this concept, a subject is presented with trait adjectives or sentences and asked whether they describe him or her. Functional neuroimaging research has revealed a set of regions known as Cortical Midline Structures (CMS) appearing to be critically involved in self-reflection processes. Furthermore, it has been shown that patients suffering damage to the CMS, have difficulties in properly evaluating the problems they encounter and often overestimate their capacities and performance. Building on previous work, a meta-analysis of published fMRI and PET studies on self-reflection was conducted. The results showed that two areas within the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) are important in reflective processing, namely the ventral (v) and dorsal (d) MPFC. In this paper a model is proposed in which the vMPFC is responsible for tagging information relevant for 'self', whereas the dMPFC is responsible for evaluation and decision-making processes in self- and other-referential processing.

She showed neither hormonal symptoms nor abnormal serum hormone levels. Ultrasound imaging showed that a heterogeneously solid and partly calcified tumor was located in the retroperitoneal space. Computed tomography showed a hypervascular tumor with central degeneration. Open laparotomy revealed that the tumor originated from the pancreas; it was removed in a mass including the spleen and the pancreatic body and tail. The resected specimen demonstrated that the 580-g tumor was multi-lobulated, encapsulated, and 14 x 14 x 7 cm in size. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of cuboidal cells with round nuclei; the cells formed palisade and trabecular structures.

A 76-year-old woman was admitted for a left upper abdominal mass. She showed neither hormonal symptoms nor abnormal serum hormone levels. Ultrasound imaging showed that a heterogeneously solid and partly calcified tumor was located in the retroperitoneal space. Computed tomography showed a hypervascular tumor with central degeneration. Open laparotomy revealed that the tumor originated from the pancreas; it was removed in a mass including the spleen and the pancreatic body and tail. The resected specimen demonstrated that the 580-g tumor was multi-lobulated, encapsulated, and 14 x 14 x 7 cm in size. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of cuboidal cells with round nuclei; the cells formed palisade and trabecular structures.

The treatment of established NRP is mainly based on the administration of coronary vasodilators, like adenosine, verapamil or nitroprusside, but clinical results are frequently disappointing. The objective of this review is to describe the state of the art of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and pharmacological management of NRP."

These errors may be compensated by means of reconstruction algorithms which take into account accurate physical models of the data acquisition procedure. Unfortunately, this approach involves high memory requirements as well as a high computational burden which cannot be afforded by the computer systems of SPECT acquisition devices. In this work the possibility of accessing High Performance Computing and Networking (HPCN) resources through a World Wide Web interface for the advanced reconstruction of SPECT data in a clinical environment was investigated. An iterative algorithm with an accurate model of the variable system response was ported on the Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD) parallel architecture of a Cray T3D massively parallel computer. The system was accessible even from low cost PC-based workstations through standard TCP/IP networking. A speedup factor of 148 was predicted by the benchmarks run on the Cray T3D. A complete brain study of 30 (64 x 64) slices was reconstructed from a set of 90 (64 x 64) projections with ten iterations of the conjugate gradients algorithm in 9 s which corresponds to an actual speed-up factor of 135. The technique was extended to a more accurate 3D modeling of the system response for a true 3D reconstruction of SPECT data; the reconstruction time of the same data set with this more accurate model was 5 min. This work demonstrates the possibility of exploiting remote HPCN resources from hospital sites by means of low cost workstations using standard communication protocols and an user-friendly WWW interface without particular problems for routine use.","World Wide Web interface for advanced SPECT reconstruction algorithms implemented on a remote massively parallel computer. - Data from Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) studies are blurred by inevitable physical phenomena occurring during data acquisition.

Two main variants have been described, sporadic and those found in association with parathyroid and pituitary tumors, a genetic disorder known as multiple endocrine neoplasia-1 (MEN-1). Biochemical serum evaluation for elevated gastrin, followed by radiological or nuclear localization of the primary lesion, is mandated for establishing diagnosis. The mainstays of treatment include management of hypersecretory state with medical suppression of gastric acid production and surgical resection of primary tumor for the prevention of malignant transformation and metastatic complications. Medical therapy with proton pump inhibitors has virtually eliminated the need for acid-reducing surgical procedures. Surgical approach to sporadic and MEN-1-associated ZES varies based on our understanding of the natural history of the condition and the probability of cure; however, resection to a negative microscopic margin is indicated in both cases. Postoperative surveillance involves measurement of gastrin level, followed by imaging if elevation is detected. Re-excision of recurrent or resection of metastatic disease is a subject of controversy; however, at the present time aggressive cytoreductive approach is favored.","Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: classical considerations and current controversies. - Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is an endocrinopathy characterized by gastrin-secreting tumors, responsible for causing the formation of multiple, refractory, and recurrent peptic ulcers in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum.

565,CD010213,0,19030194,0,Optical coherence tomography in detection of dysplasia and cancer of the gastrointestinal tract and bilio-pancreatic ductal system.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical imaging modality that performs high-resolution, cross-sectional, subsurface tomographic imaging of the microstructure of tissues. The physical principle of OCT is similar to that of B-mode ultrasound imaging, except that it uses infrared light waves rather than acoustic waves. The in vivo resolution is 10-25 times better (about 10 microns) than with high-frequency ultrasound imaging, but the depth of penetration is limited to 1-3 mm, depending upon tissue structure, depth of focus of the probe used, and pressure applied to the tissue surface. In the last decade, OCT technology has evolved from an experimental laboratory tool to a new diagnostic imaging modality with a wide spectrum of clinical applications in medical practice, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and pancreatic-biliary ductal system. OCT imaging from the GI tract can be done in humans by using narrow-diameter, catheter-based probes that can be inserted through the accessory channel of either a conventional front-view endoscope, for investigating the epithelial structure of the GI tract, or a side-view endoscope, inside a standard transparent ERCP catheter, for investigating the pancreatico-biliary ductal system. Esophagus and the esophago-gastric junction has been the most widely investigated organ so far; more recently, also duodenum, colon and pancreatico-biliary ductal system have been extensively investigated. OCT imaging of the gastro-intestinal wall structure is characterized by a multiple-layer architecture that permits an accurate evaluation of the mucosa, lamina propria, muscularis mucosae, and part of the submucosa. The technique may be, therefore, used to identify pre-neoplastic conditions of the GI tract, such as Barrett's epithelium and dysplasia, and evaluate the depth of penetration of early-stage neoplastic lesions. OCT imaging of the pancreatic and biliary ductal system could improve the diagnostic accuracy for ductal epithelial changes and the differential diagnosis between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions.","Optical coherence tomography in detection of dysplasia and cancer of the gastrointestinal tract and bilio-pancreatic ductal system. - Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical imaging modality that performs high-resolution, cross-sectional, subsurface tomographic imaging of the microstructure of tissues.

Although transcutaneous ultrasonography, computer tomography and magnetic resonance greatly improved in performance, two major problems have not been completely solved yet: first, the differentiation of malignant and benign bile duct strictures, and, second, the assessment of the resectability of carcinomas underlying biliary strictures. Ultrasound probes can be inserted through the working channel of the duodenoscope and passed selectively both into the biliary and pancreatic ducts. Ultrasound frequencies of 20 or 30 MHz enable a penetration of up to 2 cm and a resolution of 0.07 to 0.18 mm. The main clinical indication for intraductal ultrasonography of the biliary tract is obstructive jaundice, which requires assessment of bile duct strictures and local tumor staging. Miniprobes can contribute to the differential diagnosis of strictures localized in the main pancreatic duct, and also to localizing small endocrine tumors. Small tumors of the papilla of Vater can be staged before a possible endoscopic resection.

588,CD009263,0,17380017,0,Sequential activation of phospholipase-C and -D in agonist-stimulated gonadotrophs.,"The contributions of phospholipase-C and -D to diacylglycerol (DG) formation during agonist-induced cell signaling were investigated in rat pituitary cells and alpha T3-1 gonadotrophs. In both cell types, GnRH caused a biphasic increase in DG formation, with an initial spike within 60 sec, followed by a larger and sustained rise to reach a second peak after 15 min of stimulation. Both phases of DG production were temporally correlated with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3] formation, consistent with the dependence of DG formation on phospholipase-C-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. However, the ability of GnRH to stimulate phosphatidylethanol (PEt) in the presence of ethanol suggested that phospholipase-D may also participate in DG formation. Two inhibitors of phospholipase-C-dependent phosphoinositide hydrolysis, U73122 and neomycin sulfate, reduced the PEt as well as the Ins(1,4,5)P3 response to GnRH, indicating that phospholipase-D is activated during phospholipase-C-dependent signaling in pituitary gonadotrophs. The production of both DG and PEt was increased by treatment with the active phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), but not with inactive 4 alpha-phorbol 13-didecanoate, indicating that stimulation of protein kinase-C leads to activation of phospholipase-D. In accord with this, GnRH- and PMA-induced elevations of DG and PEt production were attenuated or abolished in protein kinase-C-depleted cells. In contrast, short and long term stimulation with PMA had no effect on basal inositol phosphate production. Also, GnRH-induced inositol phosphate production was not affected by protein kinase-C depletion. Finally, U73122 and neomycin sulfate did not inhibit PMA-induced PEt formation. These data indicate that GnRH activates a dual phospholipase pathway in a sequential and synchronized manner; phospholipase-C initiates the biphasic increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 and DG formation, and protein kinase-C mediates the integration of phospholipase-D into the signaling response during the sustained phase of agonist stimulation.","Sequential activation of phospholipase-C and -D in agonist-stimulated gonadotrophs. - The contributions of phospholipase-C and -D to diacylglycerol (DG) formation during agonist-induced cell signaling were investigated in rat pituitary cells and alpha T3-1 gonadotrophs.

In this study, we used positron emission tomography to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients with clinical allodynia. Nine patients with peripheral nerve injury were scanned during rest, brush-evoked allodynia, and brushing of normal contralateral skin. PET data were analyzed for the whole group and for single subjects. Allodynic stimulation activated the contralateral orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11) in every patient. Whereas normal brushing activated most strongly the contralateral insular cortex, allodynic brushing produced an ipsilateral activation in this area. Another important difference between normal and allodynic brushing was the absence of a contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI) activation during allodynic brushing. No thalamic activation was observed during allodynic or control brushing. Although no anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation could be demonstrated in the group analysis, single subject analysis revealed that four patients activated this region during brush-evoked allodynia. A direct post hoc comparison of brush -and allodynia-induced rCBF changes showed that allodynia was associated with significantly stronger activations in orbitofrontal cortex and ipsilateral insula whereas non-painful brushing more strongly activated SI and BA 5/7. These findings indicate that activity in the cortical network involved in the sensory-discriminative processing of nociceptive pain is downregulated in neuropathic pain. Instead, there is an upregulation of activity in the orbitofrontal and insular cortices, which is probably due to the stronger emotional load of neuropathic pain and higher computational demands of processing a mixed sensation of brush and pain.","A PET activation study of brush-evoked allodynia in patients with nerve injury pain. - Acute experimental brush-evoked allodynia induces a cortical activation pattern that differs from that typically seen during experimental nociceptive pain.

Although the carcinoid tumours can often be tentatively recognized in routinely processed microscopic slides, their more accurate identification requires additional diagnostic procedures. General neuroendocrine markers such as the argyrophil reaction of Grimelius and immunohistochemistry with application of antibodies against chromogranin A and of neuron-specific enolase are discriminatory staining methods which are used to reveal the neuroendocrine origin of almost all highly differentiated carcinoid tumours of the gastrointestinal tract. Mid-gut carcinoids, which predominate among these tumours almost unexceptionally contain serotonin. This biogenic amine can be demonstrated by the argentaffin reaction of Masson, serotonin immunoreactively or by formalin-induced fluorescence. The characteristic staining pattern of mid-gut carcinoids is almost invariably preserved in the metastatic deposits and consequently the staining methods for identifying serotonin can also be used on metastases to reveal a primary mid-gut carcinoid. The enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell carcinoids of the body and fundic area of the stomach often seen in association with pernicious anaemia are argyrophil with the Sevier-Munger silver stain. Other neuroendocrine tumours, viz. antral, duodenal and rectal carcinoids should be studied by a battery of relevant peptide hormone antisera for adequate diagnosis. During the last decade new peptide hormones have been found in circulation in patients with carcinoid tumours, but serotonin and urinary 5-HIAA are still the most important markers for carcinoids of the mid-gut origin. Other clinically useful tumour markers are chromogranin A + B, pancreatic polypeptide, human chorionic gonadotropin alpha and beta subunits. For localizing procedures, angiography is the most reliable investigative method for primary tumours in the gut, whereas CT-scan and ultrasound investigations are good for detection of liver metastases.

The 48-year-old woman was found to have tumor recurrence in the lymph nodes in the area between the aortic bifurcation and the paraaortic area, accompanied by left hydronephrosis, four years after surgery for sigmoid colon cancer (H0, P0, ss, n3, stage IIIb). No metastasis to distant areas was detected at that time. The woman thus underwent a reoperation. Intraoperatively, the aortic bifurcation and the lymph nodes were seen as a mass. The mass involved the left common iliac vein and the left ureter, as well. Therefore, we resected the area from the aortic bifurcation to the bilateral common iliac arteries, the left common iliac vein, the left ureter and the left kidney en bloc, and replaced them with a Y-shaped graft. One year after the reoperation, a tumor metastasis to the liver was detected, and a partial hepatectomy was performed. At present, the patient is being managed at our outpatient clinic.

Significant inflammatory change of soft tissue was noted, involving the entire right trunk from the subcostal margin to the knee joint. Painful disability of the right lower extremity and apparent signs of peritonitis at the right lower abdomen were disclosed.

In the hepato-pancreatic pathology the use of the laparoscopic echography reduces clearly the role of laparotomic exploration. In laparoscopic surgery of rectal-colon, the echography is more specific and sensitive in compared with pre-operative MR and CT to individualize liver metastasis, to locate them. This allows the treatment of such lesions through the cryosurgery. In pancreatic lesions such method plays a non releasable role in tumors staging, giving essential elements to the surgeon to operate and for a better definition of operative strategy. Also in the adrenal masses surgery, laparoscopic echography reveals very useful especially in the anatomical structures identification (i.e. renal vein and entrance of the left adrenal vein) in the patients already operated or obese. In the preoperative study of rectal tumors the use of rotating and transrectal probes allows to define the degree of infiltration of the lesion and to perform a mini-invasive treatment through endoscopic transanal microsurgery with the radiochemotherapy. Thus echography in mini-invasive surgery has an unreplaceable role both in diagnosis as in evaluation of the parameter of therapeutical approach.","[Echography in minimally invasive surgery]. - Thanks to the great development of laparoscopic surgery and his continuous technical evolution, echography plays more and more important role in the pre- and intraoperative diagnosis.

The brain HK, (HK1), like HKII and HKIII, has a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa. HKII is insulin-sensitive and found in adipose and muscle cells. HKIV, also known as glucokinase, has a molecular weight of 50 kDa and is specific to liver and pancreas. Most brain HK is bound to mitochondria via porins, enabling coordination between glucose consumption and oxidation. Tumour cells are known to be highly glycolytic, and correspondingly increased expression of glycolytic enzymes, including HK, have been detected in resected tumours from patients with lung, gastrointestinal and breast cancer. In the latter group, further increases in HK activity were associated with metastatic disease. Some studies have demonstrated increased HK activity in renal tumours, and also have reported changes in the isoenzymic expression of HK. Experimental studies of the initiation and progression of liver tumours have demonstrated a shift in expression from that of HKIV to HKI and HKII, with increased HK binding to mitochondria and a > 100-fold increase in HK activity. However, studies using xenografts derived from gliomas found decreased HK activity corresponding with loss of chromosome 10, the carrier of the HKI gene. Compared with normal tissues, a number of mechanisms are associated with changes in HK activity seen in tumours of the liver and other sites, and these include HK gene dosage, increased transcription, modulation of HK promoter activity by a broader range of effectors, and increased mitochondrial binding of HK. Increased HK activity, together with increased glucose transport by tumour cells, has been exploited in cancer imaging using the positron-labelled glucose analogue (18F)fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is transported into cells and then phosphorylated, but undergoes little further metabolism.

However, in clinical routine some misdiagnosis is still observed. This is because there is potential overlap between the semiquantitative uptake values obtained for active inflammatory lesions and cancer. Therefore, this prospective study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that analysis of dynamic kinetics of focal pancreatic lesions based on FDG PET may more accurately determine the benign or malignant nature of such lesions. Thirty patients (56+/-17 years) were studied dynamically with FDG PET for a period of 60-90 min. Patients were assigned to one of four groups: control, acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. Two observers, blinded to the clinical data, analysed the time-activity curves of FDG kinetics based on region of interest analysis. The diagnosis predicted by FDG PET was compared with the result of histological examination of the surgical specimen. Analysis of FDG kinetics revealed significant differences in the shape of the time-activity curve for controls, pancreatic cancer and inflammatory disease. Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in the time-activity curve shape for chronic pancreatitis and acute pancreatitis; this is, however, not a clinical issue. Furthermore, acquisition time (60 min vs 90 min) did not affect interpretation of the time-activity curve, so that scanning time may be regularly shortened to 60 min. Interobserver agreement was 1. Based on these findings, non-invasive differentiation between pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis was correctly predicted in all cases, as confirmed by histology. In addition, the specificity was increased compared with that obtained from standardised uptake value analysis.

From November 1996 to October 1997, 43 consecutive patients suspected to have a focal pancreatic lesion were included in a phase III study. Triphasic helical CT was performed, as well as MRI at 1.5 T, as follows: axial T1-weighted (T1w) turbo spin echo (TSE), spectral presaturation with inversion recovery (SPIR) T1w TSE, T1w turbo field echo (TFE), and SPIR T2w TSE before and after mangafodipir trisodium (0.01 mmol/ml, 0.5 ml/kg) infusion. Imaging results were correlated with surgery, laparoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasound, and biopsy. Objective measurements were performed by measuring signal intensities (SIs) of lesion and parenchyma and calculating contrast indexes (CIs) and contrast-to-noise-ratios (CNRs) to assess the delineation of the tumor. SIs were correlated with four phantom standards with a known SI. Thirty-eight pancreatic adenocarcinomas were present, as well as one cystadenoma, two papillomas, and two cases of focal pancreatitis. SI measurements revealed significant increases in CIs for the lesion compared with the parenchyma in T1w TSE (69.7 vs 152.7; P = 0. 0003) and T1w TFE (107.8 vs 194.2; P = 0.0002). These series also revealed significant increases in CNRs (for T1w TSE: 9.7 vs 13.0; P = 0.0407 and for T1w TFE: 14.5 vs 26.1; P = 0.0001). In the other series, there was no significant increase. CT detected 38 lesions, MRI without mangafodipir trisodium detected 39 lesions, and MRI with mangafodipir trisodium detected 40 lesions, giving detection accuracy rates of 88%, 91%, and 93%, respectively. Staging accuracy rates for vascular ingrowth were 81%, 75%, and 81%, respectively. Overall staging accuracy rates were 57%, 54%, and 54%, respectively, mostly due to undetected small metastases in the peritoneum, omentum, or liver (< 1 cm).

SI measurements revealed significant increases in CIs for the lesion compared with the parenchyma in T1w TSE (69.7 vs 152.7; P = 0. 0003) and T1w TFE (107.8 vs 194.2; P = 0.0002). These series also revealed significant increases in CNRs (for T1w TSE: 9.7 vs 13.0; P = 0.0407 and for T1w TFE: 14.5 vs 26.1; P = 0.0001). In the other series, there was no significant increase. CT detected 38 lesions, MRI without mangafodipir trisodium detected 39 lesions, and MRI with mangafodipir trisodium detected 40 lesions, giving detection accuracy rates of 88%, 91%, and 93%, respectively. Staging accuracy rates for vascular ingrowth were 81%, 75%, and 81%, respectively. Overall staging accuracy rates were 57%, 54%, and 54%, respectively, mostly due to undetected small metastases in the peritoneum, omentum, or liver (< 1 cm). This study indicates that a) MRI after mangafodipir trisodium gives a better delineation of the tumor in T1w series, but b) does not significantly improve the detection rate and staging accuracy of focal pancreatic lesions over MRI without this contrast medium."
691,CD009263,0,8469634,0,Discordance between thallium-201 scintigraphy and coronary angiography in patients with Kawasaki disease: myocardial ischemia with normal coronary angiogram.,"To assess the usefulness of radionuclide tests in detecting coronary occlusive lesions in children with Kawasaki disease, we compared the results of stress thallium-201 myocardial single photon emission computed tomography with dipyridamole infusion and coronary angiography in 34 patients (19 males and 15 females). Perfusion defects on the stress image only were categorized as transient and were attributed to coronary vascular disease in the presence of redistribution on the delayed image. Others were classified as persistent, due to myocardial damage. Five of the seven children (71%) with severe stenosis on coronary angiography showed persistent and/or transient perfusion defects. However, six of the 11 children (55%) with aneurysms but no obvious stenosis, and four of the 16 children (25%) with normal angiography, showed persistent and/or transient defects. After analyzing 20 individual segments of perfusion defects in the 15 children, six segments (30%) were attributed to the stenosis of supplying coronary arteries, six segments (30%) were related to the coronary aneurysms, and eight segments (40%) were unrelated to any abnormalities on angiography. Thus, significant discordance between the radionuclide and angiographic studies was demonstrated. These results suggest that coronary lesions, as conventionally defined by angiography and supplemented by echocardiography, may not completely identify all Kawasaki patients who may develop myocardial ischemia in the future or who had ischemia in the past.","Discordance between thallium-201 scintigraphy and coronary angiography in patients with Kawasaki disease: myocardial ischemia with normal coronary angiogram. - To assess the usefulness of radionuclide tests in detecting coronary occlusive lesions in children with Kawasaki disease, we compared the results of stress thallium-201 myocardial single photon emission computed tomography with dipyridamole infusion and coronary angiography in 34 patients (19 males and 15 females).

692,CD010213,0,10188780,0,The design and pharmacology of novel selective muscarinic agonists and antagonists.,"The muscarinic pharmacology of C1-methyl-substituted chiral compounds related to McN-A-343 and of (R)- and (S)-dimethindene has been studied. Among the McN-A-343 analogues, the (S)-enantiomers were more potent and had higher affinity than the (R)-isomers. The quaternary compound (S)-BN 228 was found to be the most potent M1-selective agonist known today (pEC50: M1/rabbit vas deferens = 7.83; M2/guinea-pig atria = 6.35; M3/guinea-pig ileum = 6.29). In both the atria and ileum the tertiary carbamate, (S)-4-F-MePyMcN, was a competitive antagonist (pA2 value = 7.39 and 6.82, respectively). In contrast, in rabbit vas deferens (S)-4-F-MePyMcN was a potent partial agonist (pEC50 = 7.22; apparent efficacy = 0.83). These results indicate that (S)-4-F-MePyMcN might be a useful tool to study M1 receptor-mediated effects involved in central cholinergic function. (S)-Dimethindene was a potent M2-selective antagonist (pA2 = 7.86/atria; pKi = 7.8/rat heart) with lower affinities for the M1 (pA2 = 6.36/rat duodenum; pKi = 7.1/NB-OK 1 cells), M3 (pA2 = 6.92/guinea-pig ileum; pKi = 6.7/rat pancreas) and M4 receptors (pKi = 7.0/rat striatum). It was more potent (up to 41-fold) than the (R)-isomer. In contrast, the stereoselectivity was inverse at ileal H1 receptors (pA2: (R)-isomer = 9.42; (S)-isomer = 7.48). Thus, (S)-dimethindene could be a valuable agent to test the hypothesis that M2 antagonists show beneficial effects in the treatment of cognitive disorders. It might also become the starting point for the development of diagnostic tools for quantifying M2 receptors in the CNS with PET imaging.","The design and pharmacology of novel selective muscarinic agonists and antagonists. - The muscarinic pharmacology of C1-methyl-substituted chiral compounds related to McN-A-343 and of (R)- and (S)-dimethindene has been studied.

693,CD009263,0,15693653,1,Imaging hypoxia and angiogenesis in tumors.,"There is a clear need in cancer treatment for a noninvasive imaging assay that evaluates the oxygenation status and heterogeneity of hypoxia and angiogenesis in individual patients. Such an assay could be used to select alternative treatments and to monitor the effects of treatment. Of the several methods available, each imaging procedure has at least one disadvantage. The limited quantitative potential of single-photon emission CT and MR imaging always limits tracer imaging based on these detection systems. PET imaging with FMISO and Cu-ATSM is ready for coordinated multicenter trials, however, that should move aggressively forward to resolve the debate over the importance of hypoxia in limiting response to cancer therapy. Advances in radiation treatment planning, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, provide the ability to customize radiation delivery based on physical conformity. With incorporation of regional biologic information, such as hypoxia and proliferating vascular density in treatment planning, imaging can create a biologic profile of the tumor to direct radiation therapy. Presence of widespread hypoxia in the tumor benefits from a systemic hypoxic cell cytotoxin. Angiogenesis is also an important therapeutic target. Imaging hypoxia and angiogenesis complements the efforts in development of antiangiogenesis and hypoxia-targeted drugs. The complementary use of hypoxia and angiogenesis imaging methods should provide the impetus for development and clinical evaluation of novel drugs targeted at angiogenesis and hypoxia. Hypoxia imaging brings in information different from that of FDG-PET but it will play an important niche role in oncologic imaging in the near future. FMISO, radioiodinated azamycin arabinosides, and Cu-ATSM are all being evaluated in patients. The Cu-ATSM images show the best contrast early after injection but these images are confounded by blood flow and their mechanism of localization is one step removed from the intracellular O2 concentration. FMISO has been criticized as inadequate because of its clearance characteristics, but its uptake after 2 hours is probably the most purely reflective of regional PO2 at the time the radiopharmaceutical is used. The FMISO images show less contrast than those of Cu-ATSM because of the lipophilicity and slower clearance of FMISO but attempts to increase the rate of clearance led to tracers whose distribution is contaminated by blood flow effects. For single-photon emission CT the only option is radioiodinated azamycin arabinosides, because the technetium agents are not yet ready for clinical evaluation. Rather than develop new and improved hypoxia agents, or even quibbling about the pros and cons of alternative agents, the nuclear medicine community needs to convince the oncology community that imaging hypoxia is an important procedure that can lead to improved treatment outcome.","Imaging hypoxia and angiogenesis in tumors. - There is a clear need in cancer treatment for a noninvasive imaging assay that evaluates the oxygenation status and heterogeneity of hypoxia and angiogenesis in individual patients.

694,CD010213,0,9766641,0,Loss of chromosome 18q is an early event in pancreatic ductal tumorigenesis.,"Cytogenetic and molecular studies demonstrated that pancreatic cancer frequently shows specific chromosomal abnormalities, such as losses of 9p, 17p, and 18q, and gains of 8q and 20q. We have analyzed alterations in the copy number of specific chromosomal regions in cells from the pancreatic juices of 32 patients with various pancreatic disorders by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique to pursue the possible clinical use of early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. None of the chromosomal abnormalities were found in 13 specimens from individuals who had no neoplastic lesions. On the other hand, 12 specimens (63%) derived from the remaining 19 patients who had neoplastic lesions showed at least one chromosomal abnormality. Ten of these specimens were from pancreatic cancer patients; 7 cases (70%) showed chromosomal abnormalities. All but one of the 12 tumors with chromosomal abnormalities had loss of 18q. Furthermore, we detected a tumor in one patient in whom the routine cytological method and endoscopic retrograde chorangiopancreatography found nothing. Based on the results by FISH, we performed endoscopic ultrasonography and found a small serous cystadenoma in this patient. These results indicate that: (a) FISH analysis of cells from pancreatic juices obtained during endoscopic retrograde chorangiopancreatography is quite useful for detecting pancreatic ductal tumors; and (b) loss of chromosome 18q is one of the early genetic changes that provide very useful information in diagnosing pancreatic neoplasias.","Loss of chromosome 18q is an early event in pancreatic ductal tumorigenesis. - Cytogenetic and molecular studies demonstrated that pancreatic cancer frequently shows specific chromosomal abnormalities, such as losses of 9p, 17p, and 18q, and gains of 8q and 20q.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of needle biopsy in suspicious pancreatic head neoplasia and its effect on therapy and outcome. Seventy-three patients with symptoms or signs of periampullary neoplasia and a pancreatic head lesion identified on CT scan were reviewed retrospectively. Forty patients with potentially resectable lesions underwent intraoperative transduodenal core needle biopsy of the head of the pancreas. Thirty-three patients underwent CT-guided percutaneous fine-needle aspiration. The sensitivity and specificity of core needle biopsy were 76% and 100%, respectively. One death was directly related to the procedure and therapy was adversely affected in one patient with a false negative result. The sensitivity and specificity of percutaneous fine-needle aspiration were 85% and 92%, respectively, and were not significantly different from the core needle biopsy results (P >0.3). Three false negative fine-needle aspiration biopsies occurred in patients with potentially resectable lesions and a low clinical suspicion for malignancy. In patients with a mass in the head of the pancreas on CT scan, fine-needle aspiration biopsy offers results similar to those of intraoperative transduodenal core needle biopsy. In patients estimated to have resectable disease, a pancreaticoduodenectomy should be performed without a biopsy. For patients with unresectable disease, cytologic examination of fine-needle aspirate should be performed.

On the other hand, PET detectors with a monolithic block have been investigated because they are expected to offer higher resolution than do segmented crystal arrays. However, previous reports focused on detectors dedicated as small-animal PET, and the thickness was not good enough to stop 511-keV radiation. We developed a PET detector that uses a large and thick monolithic LYSO and 64-channel PS-PMT. When the LYSO was covered with reflectors, the spatial resolution, which was 3 mm FWHM at the center, rapidly became worse at the edge. We eliminated the loss of spatial resolution by replacing the reflectors with black paper, but the light output was decreased. Therefore, we concluded that spatial resolution and light output were in a trade-off relationship due to the edge effect of scintillation light.","Basic performance of a large area PET detector with a monolithic scintillator. - Conventionally, block detectors, which consist of a two-dimensionally segmented scintillator array with inserted reflectors, are often used for PET.

We describe an unusual association between a GIST and a MEN1-related gastrinoma. A 44-year-old man had undergone surgical removal of a pancreatic gastrinoma in 2004 and was then administered long-term somatostatin analogs, and diagnosed as having MEN1 syndrome.

These technologic advances include chemical-shift imaging, fast spin-echo T2-weighted imaging and its modifications, such as MR cholangiopancreatography, and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced imaging. Taken together, these techniques can detect diseases that may be difficult to appreciate on CT, such as small pancreatic adenocarcinomas, islet cell tumors, and ductal abnormalities and calculi.

767,CD010213,0,10399976,1,Endoscopic ultrasound for diagnosis and staging of pancreatic tumors.,"Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is proving to be a useful tool for evaluation of clinically suspected pancreatic masses unsatisfactorily evaluated by other means of imaging. We reviewed the records of 19 patients who had CT and EUS performed for clinically suspected pancreatic masses. Each patient had subsequent surgical exploration. Nineteen patients (11 females and 8 males) presenting with symptoms (11 with obstructive jaundice, 6 with abdominal pain and weight loss) or incidental CT findings suspicious for pancreatic carcinoma underwent EUS for further pancreatic evaluation. All of these patients had exploratory laparotomies, with 13 pancreaticoduodenectomies, 3 distal pancreatectomies and splenectomies, 1 bypass procedure, 1 open pancreatic and hepatic biopsy showing metastatic disease, and 1 open exploration with negative fine-needle aspiration biopsy. EUS correctly identified pancreatic neoplasms in 17 of 19 cases, with two false positives. The tumors included 15 adenocarcinomas, 1 microcystic adenoma, and 1 lymphoma. Node status was correctly predicted in 9 of 12 specimens. Nine of 12 tumors had accurate tumor staging by EUS. Absence of vascular invasion was accurately predicted in 13 of 14 cases. Two patients had metastatic disease discovered at laparotomy. All 19 patients had preoperative abdominal CT scans, with six of these negative for pancreatic masses. EUS is more sensitive than CT in detecting pancreatic masses and is more accurate than CT in locally staging pancreatic tumors. This higher sensitivity is important because those patients with earlier stage tumors are the most likely to benefit from resection.","Endoscopic ultrasound for diagnosis and staging of pancreatic tumors. - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is proving to be a useful tool for evaluation of clinically suspected pancreatic masses unsatisfactorily evaluated by other means of imaging.

This retrospective study is done to assess the cytological features and pitfalls associated with these entities in cytological samples.A search for pancreatic cytology specimens with histological confirmation of the various pancreatic mucinous lesions was done from 1988 to 2005: 9 mucinous adenocarcinoma, 14 IPMN, 11 MCN, and 3 mucinous metaplasia. The majority (35/37) had been endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirations. The cellularity, background extracellular mucin, epithelial architecture, mucinous nature of the epithelium, cell shape, and nuclear features were evaluated on the cytology material. Of the 22 cytological features evaluated, the presence of three-dimensional clusters, micropapillary structures, and nuclear atypia, which includes nuclear crowding, increased N/C ratio, anisonucleosis, nuclear membrane contour irregularity, clumpy chromatin, and prominent nucleoli, was found to be consistently associated with mucinous adenocarcinoma. There were no statistically significant cytological features, which helped in differentiating IPMN, MCN, and mucinous metaplasia. There was a relatively high false-positive rate in the IPMN group (5/14, 36%). Review of the histological specimen showed severe dysplastic epithelial change in these cases. One false-positive case of mucinous metaplasia (1/3, 33%) showed marked intraepithelial acute inflammation. The cytological diagnosis of mucinous pancreatic lesions remains challenging, except for mucinous noncystic adenocarcinoma.

770,CD009263,0,12764066,0,Specific brain processing of facial expressions in people with alexithymia: an H2 15O-PET study.,"Alexithymia is a personal trait characterized by a reduced ability to identify and describe one's own feelings and is known to contribute to a variety of physical and behavioural disorders. To elucidate the pathogenesis of stress-related disorders and the normal functions of emotion, it is important to investigate the neurobiology of alexithymia. Although several neurological models of alexithymia have been proposed, there is very little direct evidence for the neural correlates of alexithymia. Using PET, we studied brain activity in subjects with alexithymia when viewing a range of emotional face expressions. Twelve alexithymic and 12 non-alexithymic volunteers (all right-handed males) were selected from 247 applicants on the basis of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with H(2)(15)O-PET while the subjects looked at angry, sad and happy faces with varying emotional intensity, as well as neutral faces. Brain response in the subjects with alexithymia significantly differed from that in the subjects without alexithymia. The alexithymics exhibited lower rCBF in the inferior and middle frontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, inferior parietal cortex and occipital cortex in the right hemisphere than the non-alexithymics. Additionally, the alexithymics showed higher rCBF in the superior frontal cortex, inferior parietal cortex and cerebellum in the left hemisphere when compared with the non-alexithymics. A covariance analysis revealed that rCBF in the inferior and superior frontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and parietal cortex in the right hemisphere correlated negatively with individual TAS-20 scores when viewing angry and sad facial expressions, and that no rCBF correlated positively with TAS-20 scores. Moreover, the anterior cingulate cortex and insula were less activated in the alexithymics' response to angry faces than their response to neutral faces. These results suggest that people with alexithymia process facial expressions differently from people without alexithymia, and that this difference may account for the disorder of affect regulation and consequent peculiar behaviour in people with alexithymia.","Specific brain processing of facial expressions in people with alexithymia: an H2 15O-PET study. - Alexithymia is a personal trait characterized by a reduced ability to identify and describe one's own feelings and is known to contribute to a variety of physical and behavioural disorders.

The plasmacytoid monocytes bound fluorescein-conjugated lectins from Canavalia ensiformis (Con A), Phaseolus vulgaris (PHA-L), Arachis hypogaea (PNA), Ricinus communis (RCA I and II), and Triticum vulgaris (WGA), but no reaction was found with those from Dolichos biflorus (DBA) and Ulex europaeus (UEA I). Fluorescence was bright and the reactivity was distributed in a granular pattern in the cytoplasm of plasmacytoid monocytes, a staining pattern similar to that of monocytes and macrophages. B and T lymphocytes usually exhibited weak staining with the same lectins, and this was limited to the cell membrane. Plasmacytoid monocytes were originally thought to be closely related to the T-cell system. The results of recent immunocytologic studies and the lectin-binding profile of plasmacytoid monocytes observed in this study, however, suggest that these cells are related to the mononuclear phagocytic system.","Lectin-binding profile of plasmacytoid monocytes. - The lectin-binding profile of plasmacytoid monocytes, also known as plasmacytoid T cells, was studied in 18 axillary lymph nodes draining invasive breast carcinomas.

The most notable improvements have been in the detection and characterization of hepatic lesions.

Both of these agents provide considerable benefit in the detection and characterization of hepatic lesions. Manganese enhancement has also proved useful in MR imaging of the pancreas, although fat-suppressed T1-weighted imaging with dynamic gadolinium enhancement has also yielded results comparable with those of contrast-enhanced CT. MR hydrography, a generic term for static fluid imaging, is another derivative of RARE fast T2-weighted imaging. MRCP, the best known example of MR hydrography, has been rapidly and widely employed as a primary method for imaging the biliary and pancreatic ducts and has become competitive with ERCP. MR vascular imaging, especially portal venography, has been used for noninvasive imaging of portal venous disease in Budd Chiari disease, before placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, and for pancreatic cancer staging. Finally, the development of conventional phased-array body coils and endorectal coils has enabled high-quality MR imaging of perirectal disease (including Crohn disease, fistula in ano, and postpartum sphincter dysfunction). Future abdominal applications of MR imaging will involve second-generation MR interventional techniques, including use of open systems, functional or diffusion-weighted imaging exploiting the molecular activity of tissues, and virtual MR endoscopy. Although CT continues to evolve as the premier technique for survey screening of the abdomen, the technical advances in MR imaging have enabled this modality to assume some special nitch roles (in which it adds unique value) in the evaluation of the abdomen.

Thirty-two patients (30 women; mean age 49) had histology-proven MCN. Twenty-seven patients had symptomatic cysts (84%). Five had a history of gallstones and/or acute pancreatitis. All patients were worked up with CT and/or MRI. Endoscopic ultrasound was performed in 14 (44%) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in six (18%). Cytology was obtained in 13 (40%). Pathology revealed 22 benign MCNs (68%), five malignant MCNs (16%), and five MCNs with borderline pathology. Preoperative workup including CT or MRI imaging and cytology suggested MCN as the lesion in 15 patients (46%). CT features by itself predicted MCN in three patients (9%). Cytology revealed another six patients (19%) with possible MCN. In this series, preoperative workup did not identify three of five patients with MCN malignancy. A preoperative diagnosis cannot be made in most patients with MCN.

880,CD010213,0,15483082,0,Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in protease inhibitor-treated and -naive human immunodeficiency virus-infected children.,"Previous pediatric studies have failed to demonstrate a clear association between protease inhibitor (PI) therapy and abnormal glucose homeostasis in HIV-infected children. To define more precisely the impact of PI therapy on glucose homeostasis in this population, we performed the insulin-modified frequent-sampling iv glucose tolerance test on 33 PI-treated and 15 PI-naive HIV-infected children. Other investigations included fasting serum lipids; glucose, insulin, and C-peptide; single-slice abdominal computed tomography; and, in a subset of PI-treated children, an oral glucose tolerance test. There were no differences between the two groups with respect to fasting serum insulin or C-peptide, homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance, or quantitative insulin sensitivity check index. The mean insulin sensitivity index of PI-treated and PI-naive children was 6.93 +/- 6.37 and 10.58 +/- 12.93 x 10(-4)min(-1) [microU/ml](-1), respectively (P = 0.17). The mean disposition index for the two groups was 1840 +/- 1575 and 3708 +/- 3005 x 10(-4)min(-1) (P = 0.013), respectively. After adjusting for potential confounding variables using multiple regression analysis, the insulin sensitivity index and disposition index of PI-treated children were significantly lower than that of PI-naive children (P = 0.01 for both). In PI-treated but not PI-naive children, insulin sensitivity correlated inversely with visceral adipose tissue area (r = -0.43, P = 0.01) and visceral to sc adipose tissue ratio (r = -0.49, P = 0.004). Mildly impaired glucose tolerance was noted in four of 21 PI-treated subjects tested. Our results demonstrate not only that PI therapy reduces insulin sensitivity in HIV-infected children but also that it impairs the beta-cell response to this reduction in insulin sensitivity and, in a subset of children, leads to the development of impaired glucose tolerance. The presence of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and the significant correlation of reduced insulin sensitivity with increased visceral adipose tissue content suggest that PI-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy is associated with the emergence of early features of a metabolic syndrome-like phenotype.","Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in protease inhibitor-treated and -naive human immunodeficiency virus-infected children. - Previous pediatric studies have failed to demonstrate a clear association between protease inhibitor (PI) therapy and abnormal glucose homeostasis in HIV-infected children.

FDG-PET is a non-invasive, functional imaging technique. FDG exploits the native glucose transporter to enter the cell. Since many tumours have enhanced glucose uptake, FDG is readily accumulated in malignant cells and can be detected by a PET camera. FDG-PET has been established as an important diagnostic tool in clinical oncology. This review deals with the current, well-established indications for FDG-PET scanning in patients with gastrointestinal cancers. In the current practice, FDG-PET is most commonly used to stage oesophageal carcinoma, to detect and stage recurrence of colorectal carcinoma and to differentiate between benign and malignant pancreatic lesions. The benefit of FDG-PET scanning in patients with oesophagus carcinoma is best established in stage IV disease, as the diagnostic accuracy to detect metastatic disease is higher compared to the combination of computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). In patients with a history of colorectal carcinoma, FDG-PET scanning is particularly effective in diagnosing recurrent disease, especially in those with a rising carcinoembryonic antigen without a suspect lesion on conventional imaging. Large series have indicated that the sensitivity and specificity for detecting recurrent colorectal carcinoma are in the range of 87%-100% and 66%-100%, respectively. Equally, FDG-PET has a high sensitivity (68%-96%) and specificity (78%-100%) in detecting pancreatic carcinoma in patients with a suspicious-looking pancreatic mass on CT scan. Lastly, we focus on the use of FDG-PET as a modality for early monitoring of treatment response in patients with gastrointestinal stromal cell tumours. Without doubt, future developments will further establish the diagnostic role of the FDG-PET scan in the care of patients with gastrointestinal cancers.","FDG-PET scanning in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancers. - This review deals with the current, well-established indications for two-(18F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning in patients with gastrointestinal cancers.

In 63 patients without hepatobiliary disease, except for a small metastatic liver tumor or cavernous hemangioma, no definite PAI was seen. Definite PAI was seen in all patients with obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, and cholangiocellular carcinoma. It was also clearly seen in all four cases of malignant lymphadenopathy in the hepatoduodenal ligament, in one of two cases of acute hepatitis, and in four of 47 cases of liver cirrhosis. However, in patients with bile duct dilatation or with gallstone or pancreatic disease without obstructive jaundice or cholangitis, no definite PAI was seen. Histologic studies of the liver performed in 23 patients with definite PAI showed edema, ductular proliferation, dilatation of lymph vessels, and inflammatory cell infiltration in portal tracts. It is concluded that definite intrahepatic PAI is a useful sign that indicates the presence of biliary or diffuse hepatic disease.","Intrahepatic periportal abnormal intensity on MR images: an indication of various hepatobiliary diseases. - The frequency and degree of intrahepatic periportal abnormal intensity (PAI) on magnetic resonance images in patients with or without various hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases were analyzed.

The clinical evidence for the benefits of PET scanning in NSCLC is substantial, showing that PET has high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for disease staging, as well as pre-therapeutic assessment in candidates for surgery and radical radiotherapy. Moreover, PET scanning can provide important information to assist in radiotherapy treatment planning, and has also been shown to correlate with responses to treatment and overall outcomes. If the government cancer waiting time targets are to be met, rapid referral from primary to secondary healthcare is essential, as is early diagnostic referral within secondary and tertiary care for techniques such as PET. Studies are also required to explore new areas in which PET may be of benefit, such as surveillance studies in high-risk patients to allow early diagnosis and optimal treatment, while PET scanning to identify treatment non-responders may help optimise therapy, with benefits both for patients and healthcare resource use. Further studies are needed into other forms of lung cancer, including small-cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. In conclusion, PET scanning has the potential to improve the diagnosis and management of lung cancer for many patients. Further studies and refinement of guidelines and procedures will maximise the benefit of this important technique.","Ensuring the right PET scan for the right patient. - Guidelines issued by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the England and Wales recommend that rapid access to (18)F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is made available to all appropriate patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The gold standard in pharmacological treatment are somatostatin analogs which can induce long-term remission even in inoperable lesions. Although NET of pancreas are very rare. they are still important diagnostic and therapeutic problem and requires interdisciplinary co-operation. The neuroendocrine tumors should be treated in centers with highest rank of references."

But, with significant recent improvements in spiral CT scanners, particularly higher resolution and ability to reconstruct 3D images, spiral CT is now increasingly accepted as being better for pancreatic cancer staging. The debate continues, however, about the best diagnostic test or combination of tests in patients with suspected pancreatic cancer. Spiral CT is more readily available than EUS-FNA and, therefore, more frequently used. In this study, we evaluated the use of EUS-FNA in conjunction with spiral CT for suspected pancreatic cancer.","Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration and multidetector spiral CT in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is now established as a valuable imaging test for diagnosing and staging pancreatic cancer.

968,CD010213,0,19306410,1,Combining fine needle aspiration with brushing cytology has improved yields in diagnosing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the diagnostic yields of combining fine needle aspiration (FNA) with brushing cytology (BC) in clinical work-up of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The study included a total of 97 patients who underwent both FNA and BC along with histologic/clinical follow-up (F/U). Cytologic diagnoses were categorized as negative for neoplasm (NEG), atypical/favor neoplasm (AN), and suspicious or positive for neoplasm (POS). Based on the cytologic diagnoses, the cohort was divided as follows: 23 had concordant FNA and BC diagnoses of POS/AN, all were neoplasms on F/U; 34 had disconcordant (POS/AN vs. NEG) FNA and BC diagnoses, all but 2 were neoplasms on F/U; The remaining 40 were NEG on both FNA and BC, F/U revealed that 10 were neoplasms and 30 were chronic pancreatitis. Overall, FNA rendered more true positive diagnoses than BC. However, BC but not FNA detected neoplasms in 10 patients. Most of the neoplasms identified on F/U were ductal adenocarcinoma (59 of 65). Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 69.2, 93.8, 95.7, 60, and 77.3% for FNA alone, 50.8, 100, 100, 50.0, and 67.0% for BC alone, and 84.6, 100, 100, 76.2, and 89.7% for combining FNA with BC. In conclusion, both EUS-guided FNA and BC are valuable modalities in the preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. When used in combination, the two modalities complement each other and achieve better diagnostic yield in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma than either FNA or BC alone.","Combining fine needle aspiration with brushing cytology has improved yields in diagnosing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. - The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the diagnostic yields of combining fine needle aspiration (FNA) with brushing cytology (BC) in clinical work-up of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

While the majority of acute pseudocysts resolve spontaneously, few may require drainage. On the other hand, pancreatic cystic tumors, which usually require extirpation, may disguise as pseudocysts. Hence, the distinction between the two entities is crucial for a successful outcome. We conducted this study to highlight the fundamental differences between pancreatic pseudocysts and cystic tumors so that relevant management plans can be devised. We reviewed the data of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions that underwent intervention between June 2007 and December 2010 in our hospital. We identified 9 patients (5 males and 4 females) with a median age of 40 years (range, 30-70 years). Five patients had pseudocysts, 2 had cystic tumors, and 2 had diseases of undetermined pathology. Pancreatic pseudocysts were treated by pseudocystogastrostomy in 2 cases and percutaneous drainage in 3 cases. One case recurred after percutaneous drainage and required pseudocystogastrostomy. The true pancreatic cysts were serous cystadenoma, which was treated by distal pancreatectomy, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, which was initially treated by drainage, like a pseudocyst, and then by distal pancreatectomy when its true nature was revealed. We conclude that every effort should be exerted to distinguish between pancreatic pseudocysts and cystic tumors of the pancreas to avoid the serious misjudgement of draining rather than extirpating a pancreatic cystic tumor. Additionally, percutaneous drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst is a useful adjunct that may substitute for surgical drainage.","Pancreatic pseudocyst or a cystic tumor of the pancreas? - Pancreatic pseudocysts are the most common cystic lesions of the pancreas and may complicate acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, or pancreatic trauma.

SUV was significantly higher in infiltrating ductal carcinomas (n = 68; median SUV = 5.6) than in lobular ones (n = 18; median SUV = 3.8), and in grade 3 carcinomas (n = 26; median SUV = 6.2) than in grade 1-2 ones (n = 60; median SUV = 4.9). Moreover, SUV was significantly higher in carcinomas with high levels of p53 (n = 12; median SUV = 9.5) than in those with low levels (n = 48; median SUV = 4.25). By contrast, there was no significant correlation between SUV and the steroid hormone receptor status or LI of tumours. Our data demonstrate that FDG uptake, expressed as SUV, is associated with certain prognostic factors in breast cancer, such as histopathological grading and p53 expression, which can be assessed only by means of postoperative in vitro examinations. Hence, the information provided by FDG-PET is to some extent related to relevant information on tumour biology. The clinical value of these data will have to be confirmed by analysis of the independence of SUV from other prognostic factors by means of a multivariate analysis performed on a larger series of patients with adequate follow-up.

In the present study we prospectively investigated 29 patients who underwent CT, FDG-PET, and surgery for IPMNs, followed by histopathological examination. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was determined on FDG-PET, and differentiation of benign from malignant IPMN was tested using various SUVmax cut-off levels and various parameters derived from the CT. SUVmax was found to be significantly higher in malignant IPMNs (4.7+/-3.0) than that in benign IPMNs (1.8+/-0.3, P=0.0011). SUVmax values correlated with the histopathological types of IPMN (adenoma/borderline lesion/carcinoma in situ/invasive carcinoma) (Spearman rank correlation 0.865, P<0.0001). The specificity, sensitivity and accuracy values were best for SUVmax of 2.5 (100, 93, and 96%, respectively). The combination of mural nodule, detected on CT, and SUVmax of 2.5 offered the best diagnosis of malignant IPMN.

However, the clinical application remains variable with sensitivities ranging from 55 to 100 per cent. We examined whether patient factors including serum calcium (Ca) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels impact the sensitivity of MIBI. We completed a retrospective review of 102 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and mild hypercalcemia who underwent preoperative MIBI. All patients underwent bilateral neck explorations with abnormalities confirmed by histopathology. MIBI sensitivity was correlated with preoperative Ca and PTH levels using univariate and logistic regression analysis. The mean preoperative Ca was 11.0 mg/dL and the mean PTH was 158 pg/mL. More than 95 per cent of patients with Ca greater than 11.3 mg/dL had a positive scan as compared with 60 per cent of those with lesser values (P = 0.0024). Similarly a serum PTH level greater than 160 pg/mL correlated with positive scans in 93 per cent as opposed to 57 per cent in those with lower levels (P = 0.006). Using a scan-directed approach 65 of 74 patients would have undergone unilateral exploration; this would yield a 7.7 per cent operative failure rate because of contralateral multigland disease. Lower Ca and PTH levels seem to correlate with reduced sensitivity of MIBI.

Mean midband fit, slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient from a linear regression of the calibrated RF power spectra were computed over regions of interest defined by the endoscopist. Linear discriminant analysis was then performed to develop a classification of the resulting spectral parameters. For lymph nodes, classification based on the midband fit and intercept provided 67% sensitivity, 82% specificity, and 73% accuracy for malignant vs. benign nodes. For pancreas, classification based on midband fit and correlation coefficient provided 95% sensitivity, 93% specificity, and 93% accuracy for diseased vs. normal pancreas and 85% sensitivity, 71% specificity, and 85% accuracy for pancreatic cancer vs. chronic pancreatitis.

1036,CD010213,0,19021219,1,Fine-needle aspiration of cystic pancreatic mucinous tumor: oncotic cell as an aiding diagnostic feature in paucicellular specimens.,"In juxtaposition with imaging studies, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration has gained popularity in the initial evaluation of pancreatic masses, especially cystic lesions of pancreas. Cystic pancreatic mucinous tumors include mucinous cystic neoplasm and intraductal papillary mucinous tumor, both of which have been known to have a low malignant potential and a high rate of association with invasive adenocarcinoma. As such, preoperative diagnosis is of great significance in guiding patient management. Although fine-needle aspiration cytological diagnosis of pancreatic tumor in cellular specimens has been well described, as with other cystic lesions, the yield of diagnostic cells from needle aspiration of cystic pancreatic mucinous tumors is typically low. Cytological diagnosis from these paucicellular specimens remains challenging. An additional compounding problem is the high frequency of gastrointestinal mucin and epithelial contamination. The diagnostic morphology and criteria in these paucicellular specimens have not been well addressed in the literature. The cytopathologists' ongoing efforts tend to improve the diagnostic accuracy. In this current study, oncotic cells, characterized by cytoplasmic swelling and karyolysis, were analyzed from 17 cases of cystic pancreatic mucinous tumor, of which the diagnosis was either confirmed by surgical resection or supported by cell block and/or increased CEA. Oncotic cells were found in variable amounts in almost all the cystic pancreatic mucinous tumors in this series. None of the five fine-needle aspirations intended for aspirations of hypoechoic nonlesional pancreas, which yielded either gastrointestinal tract material only or admixture of gastrointestinal and normal pancreatic components, was found to contain oncotic cells, evidencing the utility of oncotic cell as a surrogate morphologic marker in aiding the diagnosis of cystic pancreatic mucinous tumor as well as its differentiation from gastrointestinal contaminant, particularly in paucicellular specimens.","Fine-needle aspiration of cystic pancreatic mucinous tumor: oncotic cell as an aiding diagnostic feature in paucicellular specimens. - In juxtaposition with imaging studies, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration has gained popularity in the initial evaluation of pancreatic masses, especially cystic lesions of pancreas.

1063,CD010213,0,9825476,0,Definition of the role of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor localization.,"There are six major steps in the management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) (carcinoids and pancreatic endocrine tumors). One of the steps that is increasing in its importance is the need to assess primary tumor location and tumor extent in these patients. Without such information, it is not possible to adequately manage these patients. Conventional imaging studies (CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, angiography), functional localization studies measuring hormonal gradients, endoscopic ultrasound, and most recently, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) with [125I-DTPA-DPhe1]-octreotide have all been advocated to localize NETs in different studies. Whereas it is now established that for all NETs, except insulinomas, SRS has the greatest sensitivity, it remains unclear whether this increased sensitivity translates into increased clinical usefulness. It, therefore, remains unclear based on fiscal and clinical considerations what should be the recommended algorithm for the use of the different localization methods. To address this issue, we have recently performed two prospective studies on patients with gastrinomas. In this paper, the methods and results of each are summarized and based on these results, an algorithm for localization studies in NETs is proposed. One study assessed the role of SRS in management in 122 patients and shows that the use of SRS changed management in 47 percent of patients according to six different criteria when the patients were stratified according to their principal management problem. Determining whether liver metastases were present is one of the major goals of tumor localization studies and is frequently a source of confusion because of the difficulty in distinguishing small NETs liver metastases from hemangiomas. In the second study, the ability of SRS and other tumor localization methods to distinguish these two possibilities was assessed in 15 patients with small hemangiomas and 15 patients with small hepatic metastases (mean size 1.3 cm). SRS correctly identified 93 percent of the patients with liver metastases and was not positive in any patient with a hemangioma, suggesting it was not a liver metastases. SRS had greater negative and positive predictive value than conventional studies. Based on these two studies, and SRS's greater sensitivity and fiscal considerations, it is proposed that SRS should be the initial tumor imaging study in all NETs except insulinomas, and algorithms for the use of other localization studies in both NETs and insulinomas are proposed.","Definition of the role of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy in gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor localization. - There are six major steps in the management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) (carcinoids and pancreatic endocrine tumors).

In the second study, the ability of SRS and other tumor localization methods to distinguish these two possibilities was assessed in 15 patients with small hemangiomas and 15 patients with small hepatic metastases (mean size 1.3 cm). SRS correctly identified 93 percent of the patients with liver metastases and was not positive in any patient with a hemangioma, suggesting it was not a liver metastases. SRS had greater negative and positive predictive value than conventional studies. Based on these two studies, and SRS's greater sensitivity and fiscal considerations, it is proposed that SRS should be the initial tumor imaging study in all NETs except insulinomas, and algorithms for the use of other localization studies in both NETs and insulinomas are proposed."

In two patients with pheochromocytoma, the 123I-MIBG and 131I-MIBG scans were performed and both images were compared. In a patient with single intraadrenal pheochromocytoma, the lesion not detected with 131I-MIBG was clearly visualized with 123I-MIBG. In the other patient with multiple metastatic pheochromocytoma, much more lesions were distinctly demonstrated on the 123I-MIBG images than on the 131I-MIBG images. All of the lesions were detected with 123I-MIBG in a patient with pheochromocytoma, 3 patients with neuroblastoma and a patient with medullary thyroid cancer.

The key to the diagnosis is a dramatically elevated pleural fluid amylase. This pancreatic pleural effusion is also called a pancreatic pleural fistula. It is characterized by profuse pleural fluid and has a tendency to recur. Here we report a case of delayed internal pancreatic fistula with pancreatic pleural effusion emerging after splenectomy. From the treatment of this case, we conclude that the symptoms and signs of a subphrenic effusion are often obscure; abdominal computed tomography may be required to look for occult, intra-abdominal infection; and active conservative treatment should be carried out in the early period of this complication to reduce the need for endoscopy or surgery.","Delayed internal pancreatic fistula with pancreatic pleural effusion postsplenectomy. - The occurrence of pancreatic pleural effusion, secondary to an internal pancreatic fistula, is a rare clinical syndrome and diagnosis is often missed.

1120,CD010213,0,9949265,0,Role of chemoembolization in synchronous liver metastases from pancreatic endocrine tumours.,"Endocrine tumours of the pancreas, even in case of liver involvement, are generally characterized by a slower evolution and a better prognosis, if compared with ductal carcinoma. This fact gives reason to a radical surgical approach, whenever possible, and to the research of any effective adjuvant treatment. For this purpose, hepatic transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been proposed in recent years for the treatment of metastatic endocrine tumours. Out of 80 patients suffering from endocrine tumours of the pancreas, observed between January 1985 and December 1996, 28 (35%) presented liver metastases at the time of diagnosis. Twelve of these patients were submitted to palliative resection of pancreatic tumour and one or more cycles of TACE. Overall survival was 50% (6/12); median survival was 35.4 months (range 4-75). These results suggest that chemoembolization, combined with surgical resection of primary malignancy, appears to be able to control the disease for a certain time and to increase the survival rate.","Role of chemoembolization in synchronous liver metastases from pancreatic endocrine tumours. - Endocrine tumours of the pancreas, even in case of liver involvement, are generally characterized by a slower evolution and a better prognosis, if compared with ductal carcinoma.

In this study, we suggest a new method. Eight healthy adult dogs were included in the trial. All cases were operated by the same surgeon and the liver, pancreas, spleen, kidney and bowel tissue were exposed. The probes of the device, which were designed for this study, were inserted on the organ parenchyma. The device, a neonatal pulse oximeter, has two probes that were fixed by a holder in front of each other; the distance between the probes was changeable via a spring. The pulse and the oxygen saturation of the tissue were measured initially. Following this, by inducing ischemia with vessel clamping, the pulse and the oxygen saturation were measured again. The collected data were analyzed under the supervision of a statistician. In the liver and spleen, we could not detect a clear pulse wave and oxygenation. On the other hand, in the pancreas, kidney and bowel, we detected a clear curve of oxygenation and pulse in all cases. Obstruction caused significant changes: the pulse was not detected and the oxygenation decreased significantly. Our study suggests that with early diagnosis, the surgeons can detect arterial occlusion immediately and early intervention may decrease parenchymal damage. This study is the first experience in this field, and these findings need to be validated with further studies.","The use of micro pulse oximetery as a new detector of tissue perfusion in solid organ transplantation. - Vascular complications are a frequent cause of transplant failure; angiography, duplex sonography, computerized tomography (CT) scan, CT-angiography and microdialysis are the methods that were suggested for the detection of arterial obstruction after transplantation.

This has allowed CT to remain the gold standard for the evaluation of pancreatic pathology despite the advent of other imaging modalities, including MRI, PET and endoscopic ultrasound. Initially, CT scanners could only obtain 10-mm-thick slices at a rate of 4 slices per minute. Today, the current state of the art is multidetector CT (MDCT) technology, which allows the entire pancreas to be imaged by 1-mm slices in under 20 s. In addition, these new scanners allow true volume acquisition. The resultant data sets can be displayed not only as axial slices but also as a three-dimensional (3D) volume. The detail of these reconstructions when performed with volume rendering and maximum intensity projection techniques allows a detailed vascular mapping with accuracy that may exceed classic angiography. The use of thin collimation and dual-phase acquisition also improves the detection of hepatic metastasis as well as other sites of extrapancreatic disease. This article reviews the current state of the art of pancreatic imaging with specific emphasis on the use of MDCT, volume acquisitions and 3D arterial- and venous-phase vascular mapping.

1187,CD009263,0,19884537,1,Scatter correction for large non-human primate brain imaging using microPET.,"The baboon is well suited to pre-clinical evaluation of novel radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET). We have previously demonstrated the feasibility of using a high resolution animal PET scanner for this application in the baboon brain. However, the non-homogenous distribution of tissue density within the head may give rise to photon scattering effects that reduce contrast and compromise quantitative accuracy. In this study, we investigated the magnitude and distribution of scatter contributing to the final reconstructed image and its variability throughout the baboon brain using phantoms and Monte Carlo simulated data. The scatter fraction is measured up to 36% at the centre of the brain for a wide energy window (350-650 keV) and 19% for a narrow (450-650 keV) window. We observed less than 3% variation in the scatter fraction throughout the brain and found that scattered events arising from radioactivity outside the field of view contribute less than 1% of measured coincidences. In a contrast phantom, scatter and attenuation correction improved contrast recovery compared with attenuation correction on its own and reduced bias to less than 10% at the expense of the reduced signal-to-noise ratio. We conclude that scatter correction is a necessary step for ensuring high quality measurements of the radiotracer distribution in the baboon brain with a microPET scanner, while it is not necessary to model out of field of view scatter or a spatially variant scatter function.","Scatter correction for large non-human primate brain imaging using microPET. - The baboon is well suited to pre-clinical evaluation of novel radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET).

The calculation process consisted of three steps, including the procedures of incorporating background radioactivity contaminated from the previous scan. Feasibility of this approach was tested on clinical SPECT studies on 16 subjects. Two sequential SPECT scans, 30 min apart, were carried out on each subject, after each of two split-dose administrations of 111 MBq IMP. Of these, 11 subjects received acetazolamide at 10 min before the second IMP injection. Additional PET scans were also carried out on 6 subjects on a separate day, at rest and after acetazolamide administration. The other 5 subjects were scanned only at rest during the whole study period. Quantitative CBF obtained by this method was in a good agreement with those determined with PET (y(ml/100 g/min)=1.07x(ml/100 g/min)-1.14, r=0.94). Vasareactivity was approximately 40% over the whole cerebral area on healthy controls, which was consistent with a literature value.

When nonsymptomatic, in selected patients, they can be managed without surgery; however, a high degree of diagnostic reliability is crucial. We admitted 100 consecutive cases (87 women with a median age of 51.86 years). Of these, 44 were symptomatic and 56 were diagnosed incidentally. Ultrasound correctly diagnosed 53% of the cases, incorrectly 31%, and was nondiagnostic in 16%. Computed tomography scan had similar rates (54%, 34% and 12%, respectively), while magnetic resonance imaging improved diagnostic accuracy to 74% and reduced incorrect diagnoses to 26%.

When nonsymptomatic, in selected patients, they can be managed without surgery; however, a high degree of diagnostic reliability is crucial. We admitted 100 consecutive cases (87 women with a median age of 51.86 years). Of these, 44 were symptomatic and 56 were diagnosed incidentally. Ultrasound correctly diagnosed 53% of the cases, incorrectly 31%, and was nondiagnostic in 16%. Computed tomography scan had similar rates (54%, 34% and 12%, respectively), while magnetic resonance imaging improved diagnostic accuracy to 74% and reduced incorrect diagnoses to 26%. In 21 cases, exploratory needle aspiration of the cyst was carried out; only 8 samples (38%) resulted in a diagnosis; in 12 patients (57%) insufficient material was acquired to allow for diagnosis, one case demonstrated epithelial dysplasia. In 1 patient an exploratory puncture resulted in a very serious bleeding. Sixty-eight patients were treated surgically, the 44 symptomatic cases and another 24 patients with ill-defined oligocystic lesions that could not be differentiated as serous or mucinous in the preoperative period.

Exocrine pancreatic function impairment was found in 63.8%, glucose impaired tolerance (GIT)-in 12.8% overt diabetes-in 17.0%. GIT and overt diabetes were found only in patients with severe exocrine function impairment requiring enzyme supplementation. Ultrasound revealed pancreatic structure abnormalities mostly pancreas enlargement, pseudocysts, structural heterogeneity, contour irregularity, Wirsung duct dilatation and calcifications in 36.21% patients and computed tomography in 44.7%. Out of 16 patients with concomittant pathology found in SCT, US and CT 14 (29.8%) suffered from attacks of abdominal pain. We conclude that, as reflected by clinical symptoms, exo- and endocrine pancreatic function tests and imaging techniques, in about one third of patients even a moderate attack of a.a.p may lead to chronic pancreatitis. We suggest that patients after acute alcoholic pancreatitis should undergo prospective evaluation including both the function and structure estimation in order to early recognize and treat the revealed changes.","Acute alcoholic pancreatitis does not lead to complete recovery. - The aim of the study was to determine the late outcome of acute alcoholic pancreatitis (a.a.p.), as assessed by clinical examination, functional tests and imaging techniques. 47 patients, 4-7 years after a.a.p. of moderate clinical course underwent a secretin-cerulein test (SCT), glucose tolerance test (GTT), ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) of the pancreas.

Radionuclide studies are preferentially performed using small colloids, which have limited availability in our country. The possibility of using phytate for sentinel node mapping was raised because of the similarity between its biodistribution and that of nanocolloids in the reticulo-endothelial system. In this paper we evaluated the use of 99mTc-phytate for sentinel node mapping, correlating the histopathological results with the status of the rest of the lymph node chain in different malignant tumours. A total of 100 patients were studied. group 1 consisted of 62 patients with breast cancer, group 2 of 20 patients with melanoma and group 3 of 18 patients with vulvar carcinoma. Lymph node scintigraphy was carried out after injecting 99mTc-phytate subdermally, and the sentinel node projection was marked on the skin. After 18-24 h, intraoperative sentinel node localisation was performed using a gamma probe (combined with visual localisation using patent blue dye) in 75 patients, and lymph node dissection was then carried out. Radionuclide scintigraphy identified the sentinel node in 98% of all studies. Intraoperative detection using the gamma probe was equally efficient: group 1=93% (38/41), group 2=95% (18/19) and group 3=100% (15/15). The sentinel node was involved in 41%, 31% and 20% of cases in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Among the patients with positive nodes, the sentinel node was the only one affected in 53% of group 1, 50% of group 2 and 67% of group 3 cases. The method's negative predictive value was 91% in group 1 and 100% in the other groups. One false-negative study occurred in a patient who had a multifocal tumour and an intraparenchymatous lymph node; another occurred in a patient with a macroscopically affected node found during surgery. There were no side-effects related to the 99mTc-phytate. It is concluded that scintigraphic and intraoperative sentinel node identification was satisfactorily performed using 99mTc-phytate. The results were comparable to those previously described in the literature using other radiopharmaceuticals. Easy availability and low cost justify the use of phytate in our practice.","The use of 99mTc-phytate for sentinel node mapping in melanoma, breast cancer and vulvar cancer: a study of 100 cases. - Sentinel node mapping reduces surgical morbidity and allows the use of more accurate tumour staging techniques.

A large number of radiotracers have been studied as imaging agents, but only a few have found clinical applications in pharmacology. A potential radiopharmaceutical is designed with very specific physiochemical characteristics, but, generally, less attention is paid to its adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties, especially metabolism. Understanding the metabolic fate of radiopharmaceutical probes is essential for an accurate analysis and interpretation of PET measurements. The inherent inability of PET to differentiate between a parent compound and its metabolites confounds the interpretation of images and may impact the identification of the pathologically induced biochemical changes under investigation. Cytochrome P450 plays a major role in mammalian xenobiotic biotransformation and many in vitro methods are available to study and predict drug metabolism. The purpose of this review is to highlight the existing in vitro techniques available to investigate the biotransformation of xenobiotics in a fashion analogous to small molecule drug discovery. The aim is to facilitate the development and validation phases of PET tracers during preclinical evaluation. Emphasis is placed also on describing how cross species comparisons are essential in establishing appropriate translational pharmacology. Procedures of analysis (tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry), typically used for studying the metabolism of drugs, are proposed as quick and accurate tools for the determination of a radiopharmaceutical's metabolic stability at the tracer level.","Cytochrome P450 and radiopharmaceutical metabolism. - Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful non-invasive probe to investigate human physiology.

1245,CD009263,0,18356459,1,Overlap in the functional neural systems involved in semantic and episodic memory retrieval.,"Neuroimaging and neuropsychological data suggest that episodic and semantic memory may be mediated by distinct neural systems. However, an alternative perspective is that episodic and semantic memory represent different modes of processing within a single declarative memory system. To examine whether the multiple or the unitary system view better represents the data we conducted a network analysis using multivariate partial least squares (PLS ) activation analysis followed by covariance structural equation modeling (SEM) of positron emission tomography data obtained while healthy adults performed episodic and semantic verbal retrieval tasks. It is argued that if performance of episodic and semantic retrieval tasks are mediated by different memory systems, then there should differences in both regional activations and interregional correlations related to each type of retrieval task, respectively. The PLS results identified brain regions that were differentially active during episodic retrieval versus semantic retrieval. Regions that showed maximal differences in regional activity between episodic retrieval tasks were used to construct separate functional models for episodic and semantic retrieval. Omnibus tests of these functional models failed to find a significant difference across tasks for both functional models. The pattern of path coefficients for the episodic retrieval model were not different across tasks, nor were the path coefficients for the semantic retrieval model. The SEM results suggest that the same memory network/system was engaged across tasks, given the similarities in path coefficients. Therefore, activation differences between episodic and semantic retrieval may ref lect variation along a continuum of processing during task performance within the context of a single memory system.","Overlap in the functional neural systems involved in semantic and episodic memory retrieval. - Neuroimaging and neuropsychological data suggest that episodic and semantic memory may be mediated by distinct neural systems.

A common channel can be so long that the junction of the pancreatic and bile ducts is located outside of the duodenal wall, as occurs in pancreaticobiliary maljunction; in such cases, the action of the sphincter does not functionally affect the junction. Thus, biliopancreatic and pancreatobiliary refluxes occur, resulting in various pathological conditions in the biliary tract and in the pancreas. Biliopancreatic reflux could be confirmed by operative or postoperative T tube cholangiography, computed tomography combined with drip infusion cholangiography, histological detection of gallbladder cancer cells in the main pancreatic duct, and reflux of bile on the cut surface of the pancreas.

Three closely apposed regions in the left inferior frontal cortex and one in the right cerebellum were significantly active above baseline in the semantic tasks, but not in the nonsemantic task. The activity in two of the frontal regions was modulated by the difficulty of the semantic judgment. Other regions, including some in the left temporal cortex and the cerebellum, were active across all four language tasks. Thus, in addition to a number of regions known to be active during language processing, regions in the left inferior frontal cortex were specifically recruited during semantic processing in a task-dependent manner. A region in the right cerebellum may be functionally related to those in the left inferior frontal cortex. Discussion focuses on the implications of these results for current views regarding neural substrates of semantic processing.","Task-dependent modulation of regions in the left inferior frontal cortex during semantic processing. - To distinguish areas involved in the processing of word meaning (semantics) from other regions involved in lexical processing more generally, subjects were scanned with positron emission tomography (PET) while performing lexical tasks, three of which required varying degrees of semantic analysis and one that required phonological analysis.

1293,CD010213,0,24504548,1,Next generation sequencing improves the accuracy of KRAS mutation analysis in endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration pancreatic lesions.,"The use of endoscopic ultrasonography has allowed for improved detection and pathologic analysis of fine needle aspirate material for pancreatic lesion diagnosis. The molecular analysis of KRAS has further improved the clinical sensitivity of preoperative analysis. For this reason, the use of highly analytical sensitive and specific molecular tests in the analysis of material from fine needle aspirate specimens has become of great importance. In the present study, 60 specimens from endoscopic ultrasonography fine needle aspirate were analyzed for KRAS exon 2 and exon 3 mutations, using three different techniques: Sanger sequencing, allele specific locked nucleic acid PCR and Next Generation sequencing (454 GS-Junior, Roche). Moreover, KRAS was also tested in wild-type samples, starting from DNA obtained from cytological smears after pathological evaluation. Sanger sequencing showed a clinical sensitivity for the detection of the KRAS mutation of 42.1%, allele specific locked nucleic acid of 52.8% and Next Generation of 73.7%. In two wild-type cases the re-sequencing starting from selected material allowed to detect a KRAS mutation, increasing the clinical sensitivity of next generation sequencing to 78.95%. The present study demonstrated that the performance of molecular analysis could be improved by using highly analytical sensitive techniques. The Next Generation Sequencing allowed to increase the clinical sensitivity of the test without decreasing the specificity of the analysis. Moreover we observed that it could be useful to repeat the analysis starting from selectable material, such as cytological smears to avoid false negative results.","Next generation sequencing improves the accuracy of KRAS mutation analysis in endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration pancreatic lesions. - The use of endoscopic ultrasonography has allowed for improved detection and pathologic analysis of fine needle aspirate material for pancreatic lesion diagnosis.

1320,CD010213,0,24259956,0,Diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.,"Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is an important cause of maldigestion and a major complication in chronic pancreatitis. Normal digestion requires adequate stimulation of pancreatic secretion, sufficient production of digestive enzymes by pancreatic acinar cells, a pancreatic duct system without significant outflow obstruction and adequate mixing of the pancreatic juice with ingested food. Failure in any of these steps may result in pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which leads to steatorrhea, weight loss and malnutrition-related complications, such as osteoporosis. Methods evaluating digestion, such as fecal fat quantification and the (13)C-mixed triglycerides test, are the most accurate tests for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, but the probability of the diagnosis can also be estimated based on symptoms, signs of malnutrition in blood tests, fecal elastase 1 levels and signs of morphologically severe chronic pancreatitis on imaging. Treatment for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency includes support to stop smoking and alcohol consumption, dietary consultation, enzyme replacement therapy and a structured follow-up of nutritional status and the effect of treatment. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is administered in the form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres during meals.

In cases that do not respond to initial treatment, the doses can be doubled, and proton inhibitors can be added to the treatment. This review focuses on current concepts of the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.","Diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. - Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is an important cause of maldigestion and a major complication in chronic pancreatitis. Normal digestion requires adequate stimulation of pancreatic secretion, sufficient production of digestive enzymes by pancreatic acinar cells, a pancreatic duct system without significant outflow obstruction and adequate mixing of the pancreatic juice with ingested food. Failure in any of these steps may result in pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, which leads to steatorrhea, weight loss and malnutrition-related complications, such as osteoporosis. Methods evaluating digestion, such as fecal fat quantification and the (13)C-mixed triglycerides test, are the most accurate tests for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, but the probability of the diagnosis can also be estimated based on symptoms, signs of malnutrition in blood tests, fecal elastase 1 levels and signs of morphologically severe chronic pancreatitis on imaging. Treatment for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency includes support to stop smoking and alcohol consumption, dietary consultation, enzyme replacement therapy and a structured follow-up of nutritional status and the effect of treatment. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is administered in the form of enteric-coated minimicrospheres during meals. The dose should be in proportion to the fat content of the meal, usually 40-50000 lipase units per main meal, and half the dose is required for a snack. In cases that do not respond to initial treatment, the doses can be doubled, and proton inhibitors can be added to the treatment.

Sixty-four patients suspected of pancreatic cancer were studied prospectively, and the results of imaging techniques were compared to histology and surgical exploration. There were 49 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 11 of pancreatitis, 2 of common bile duct carcinoma, 1 lymphoma and 1 hepatocellular carcinoma with peripancreatic metastatic lymph nodes. EUS was significantly more accurate (91%) than CT (66%) and US (64%) for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. EUS was able to image all 7 cancers less than 25 mm in diameter, US and CT only one. There were 4 false positives with EUS which were all cases of pseudotumorous pancreatitis. For detecting lymph node involvement, EUS was significantly more sensitive (62%) and accurate (74%) than US (8% and 37%) and CT (19% and 42%), respectively. Invaded lymph nodes adjacent to large tumors and micrometastatic involvement were responsible for this lack of sensitivity. EUS was significantly more sensitive (100%) than CT (71%) and US (17%) for detecting venous involvement. The specificity of EUS was lower (67%) because of duodenal bulb stenosis and large tumors.

It is usually not possible to separate a pseudocyst from a benign cyst or a cystic tumor, but there are some signs and findings that could be helpful in the clinical decision. The diagnosis of a cystic pancreatic tumor requires different imaging techniques, including ultrasonography, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, but to distinguish a pseudocyst or a benign cyst from a potentially malignant lesion can be very difficult. The usefulness of blood tests and investigations of cyst fluid can be questionable. Today, surgical treatment of cystic pancreatic tumors can be performed with low morbidity. Therefore, we conclude that an active strategy with resection of cystic tumors of the pancreas should be recommended."

Lymphoscintigraphy associated with gamma-probe guided surgery reliably detects sentinel nodes in melanoma and breast cancer patients. This study evaluates the feasibility of the surgical identification of sentinel groin nodes using lymphoscintigraphy and a gamma-detecting probe in patients with early vulvar cancer. Technetium-99m-labelled colloid human albumin was administered perilesionally in 37 patients with invasive epidermoid vulvar cancer (T1-T2) and lymphoscintigraphy performed the day before surgery. An intraoperative gamma-detecting probe was used to identify sentinel nodes during surgery. A complete inguinofemoral node dissection was then performed. Sentinel nodes were submitted separately to pathologic evaluation. A total of 55 groins were dissected in 37 patients. Localization of the SN was successful in all cases. Eight cases had positive nodes: in all the sentinel node was positive; the sentinel node was the only positive node in five cases. Twenty-nine patients showed negative sentinel nodes: all of them were negative for lymph node metastases. Lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel-node biopsy under gamma-detecting probe guidance proved to be an easy and reliable method for the detection of sentinel node in early vulvar cancer. This technique may represent a true advance in the direction of less aggressive treatments in patients with vulvar cancer.","Sentinel node biopsy in early vulvar cancer. - Lymph node pathologic status is the most important prognostic factor in vulvar cancer; however, complete inguinofemoral node dissection is associated with significant morbidity.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is a suitable and cost-effective technique for obtaining cytohistologic material to confirm the diagnosis. EUS is capable of both characterizing the lesion and then guiding the FNA under real-time (RT) ultrasound guidance using a through-the-scope needle aspiration system. The goal of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of this technique and to describe the clinicopathologic features. Sixty patients underwent EUS-guided RTFNA of 64 lesions, including pancreas (n = 45), periluminal lymph nodes (n = 12), mediastinal and retroperitoneal masses (n = 4), and hepatobiliary masses (n = 3). Follow-up data were obtained by surgery, histopathology, or clinical course. Thirty-one lesions were malignant, eight were atypical/suspicious, 16 were non-neoplastic, and nine were non-diagnostic. Of the 55 lesions with sufficient material for interpretation, 54 had follow-up confirmation of the RTFNA diagnosis. The calculated sensitivity and specificity for malignancy was 90% and 100%, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy for malignancy was excellent for gastrointestinal associated lymph nodes (100%), mediastinal and retroperitoneal masses (100%), somewhat less so for pancreatic tumors (94%), and poor for hepatobiliary lesions (33%). EUS-guided RTFNA is accurate for sampling small gastrointestinal tract-associated lesions. EUS-guided RTFNA should be considered as a procedure of choice in selected patients when the results will influence management decisions.","Endoscopic ultrasound-guided real-time fine-needle aspiration: clinicopathologic features of 60 patients. - Diagnosis of lesions of the gastrointestinal tract and adjacent structures is possible using an imaging modality, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS).

A group of 106 patients with unclear pancreatic masses were recruited for the study. PET was performed following intravenous administration of an average of 190 MBq [18F]FDG. Focally increased glucose utilisation was used as the criterion of malignancy. In addition, the ""standardised uptake value"" (SUV) was determined 45 min after injection. Carcinoma of the pancreas was demonstrated histologically in 74 cases, and chronic pancreatitis in 32 cases. Employing visual evaluation, 63 of the 74 (85%) pancreatic carcinomas were identified by PET. In 27 of the 32 cases (84%) of chronic pancreatitis it was possible to exclude malignancy. False-negative results (n=11) were obtained mostly in patients with raised serum glucose levels (10 out of 11), and false-positives (n=5) in patients with inflammatory processes of the pancreas. Thus PET showed an overall sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 84%, a negative predictive value of 71%, and a positive predictive value of 93%. In a subgroup of patients with normal serum glucose levels (n=72), the results were 98%, 84%, 96% and 93%, respectively. Quantitative assessment yielded a mean SUV of 6.4+/-3.6 for pancreatic carcinoma as against a value of 3.6+/-1.7 for chronic pancreatitis (P<0.001), without increasing the diagnostic accuracy. This shows PET to be of value in assessing unclear pancreatic masses. The diagnostic accuracy of PET examinations is very dependent on serum glucose levels.","Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma: a report of 106 cases. - The aim of this study was to evaluate fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG PET) as a tool for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma while taking into account serum glucose level.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspirations (EUS-guided FNA) were performed in 8/15 cases. Patients' demographics, cytohistologic correlation and tumor characteristics were evaluated. Eleven of the 15 subjects were female and four were male with an age range of 17-73 years. Twelve SPN were located in the pancreatic body/tail, and three in the head. Tumor size ranged from 1.5 to 8.5 cm and 11 were solid. Of the eight EUS-guided FNA, four were diagnosed as SPN, two as SPN vs. PanNET, one as malignant with signet ring features, and one was nondiagnostic. Immunohistochemistry was performed on six/eight FNA cell blocks and 13/15 surgical specimens. Two of the 15 cases were classified as clear cell variants of SPN. Our study shows that SPN may occur in males and older adults, and present as a small or solid tumor. The clear cell variant of SPN, characterized by vacuolated cytoplasm and signet cell morphology, may pose a diagnostic challenge on FNA.

1465,CD010213,0,21822037,1,Differential diagnosis between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer: a prospective study of 156 patients.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the efficacy of different imaging methods in differentiating between chronic pancreatitis and cancer in focal pancreatic lesions and staging of adenocarcinoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Between June 2005 and October 2007, 156 consecutive patients were enrolled into the prospective clinical trial. The patients were randomized into two groups. Ultrasonoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound were performed in both the groups. Group A patients were additionally examined by computed tomography and tumor marker assay, while in the group B, intraoperative ultrasonoscopy with biopsy and urgent histological examination were done. Results of each imaging technique regarding differential diagnosis and cancer stage were compared with the findings of surgical and histological examination. RESULTS. Chronic pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma were documented in 58 (37.2%) and 78 (50%) patients, respectively. The size of the lesions and clinical presentation were similar in both the groups, but cancer patients were older than patients with pancreatitis (P<0.001). Preoperatively endosonoscopy had the highest accuracy in assessing differential diagnosis (92.1%) and adenocarcinoma (91.8%), whereas computed tomography had the highest accuracy in assessing tumor size (84.5%) and transabdominal ultrasonography in assessing lymph node involvement (78.9%) and distant metastases (88.6%).

MATERIAL AND METHODS. Between June 2005 and October 2007, 156 consecutive patients were enrolled into the prospective clinical trial. The patients were randomized into two groups. Ultrasonoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound were performed in both the groups. Group A patients were additionally examined by computed tomography and tumor marker assay, while in the group B, intraoperative ultrasonoscopy with biopsy and urgent histological examination were done. Results of each imaging technique regarding differential diagnosis and cancer stage were compared with the findings of surgical and histological examination. RESULTS. Chronic pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma were documented in 58 (37.2%) and 78 (50%) patients, respectively. The size of the lesions and clinical presentation were similar in both the groups, but cancer patients were older than patients with pancreatitis (P<0.001). Preoperatively endosonoscopy had the highest accuracy in assessing differential diagnosis (92.1%) and adenocarcinoma (91.8%), whereas computed tomography had the highest accuracy in assessing tumor size (84.5%) and transabdominal ultrasonography in assessing lymph node involvement (78.9%) and distant metastases (88.6%). Intraoperative ultrasound was the most accurate imaging technique in the assessment of differential diagnosis (100%), adenocarcinoma (98.5%), extent of primary tumor (84.8%), lymph node involvement (87.9%), and distant metastases (100%).

This technology provides hybrid images of two independent modalities, a functional scintigraphic technique and an anatomical procedure, yielding a superior imaging study. Scintigraphy is based on the use of single photon or positron emitting tracers providing a description of function or processes, whereas computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depict the precise localization and type of morphological changes that have occurred in the lesions.

This technology provides hybrid images of two independent modalities, a functional scintigraphic technique and an anatomical procedure, yielding a superior imaging study. Scintigraphy is based on the use of single photon or positron emitting tracers providing a description of function or processes, whereas computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depict the precise localization and type of morphological changes that have occurred in the lesions.

1494,CD010213,0,18956589,0,Endoscopic ultrasound: moving from diagnostics to therapeutics.,"Endoscopic ultrasound was initially introduced in the 1980s as a diagnostic modality using echoendoscopes with radial scanning that permitted reconstruction of cross-sectional images similar to computed tomography The close proximity of the ultrasound transducer to the gastrointestinal wall and retroperitoneal structures allowed a detailed examination that is not possible with cross-sectional imaging such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. It proved to be highly accurate and useful in the staging of gastrointestinal malignancies, as well as in characterizing the nature of subepithelial lesions and disorders of the pancreaticobiliary system. The introduction of linear echoendoscopes facilitated fine needle aspiration because, with linear scanning, it was able to trace the path of the tip of the needle during the puncture process. In addition to being very useful for tissue acquisition for diagnostic purposes, the principles behind endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration paved the way for the development of therapeutic endoscopic ultrasound. Substances could now be delivered by endoscopic ultrasound into targeted areas, an example being an endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus block and neurolysis. In addition, the endoscopic ultrasound-guided puncture of fluid collections, abscesses and obstructed biliary and pancreatic ductal systems facilitated the passage of guidewires, thus allowing therapeutic drainage procedures to be performed using the Seldinger technique. This review summarizes the diagnostic capability of endoscopic ultrasound and then moves on to elaborate in detail its therapeutic capability and potential.","Endoscopic ultrasound: moving from diagnostics to therapeutics. - Endoscopic ultrasound was initially introduced in the 1980s as a diagnostic modality using echoendoscopes with radial scanning that permitted reconstruction of cross-sectional images similar to computed tomography The close proximity of the ultrasound transducer to the gastrointestinal wall and retroperitoneal structures allowed a detailed examination that is not possible with cross-sectional imaging such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

Retroperitoneal fibrosis can be of 2 types: idiopathic and secondary. The recently advocated concept and diagnostic criteria of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease, derived from research on autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), has led to widespread recognition of retroperitoneal fibrosis as a condition caused by IgG4-related disease. We now know that previously diagnosed idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis includes IgG4-related disease; however, the actual prevalence is unclear. Conversely, some reports on AIP suggest that retroperitoneal fibrosis is concurrently found in about 10% of IgG4-related disease. Because retroperitoneal fibrosis has no specific symptoms, diagnosis is primarily based on diagnostic imaging (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging), which is also useful in evaluating the effect of therapy. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis can occur at different times with other lesions of IgG4-related disease including AIP. Thus, the IgG4 assay is recommended to diagnose idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis. High serum IgG4 levels should be treated and monitored as a symptom of IgG4-related disease. The first line of treatment for retroperitoneal fibrosis is steroid therapy regardless of its cause. For patients with concurrent AIP, i.e., IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis, the starting dose of steroid is usually 30-40 mg/d. The response to steroid therapy is generally favorable. In most cases, the pancreatic lesion and retroperitoneal fibrosis improve after the initial treatment.

For patients with concurrent AIP, i.e., IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis, the starting dose of steroid is usually 30-40 mg/d. The response to steroid therapy is generally favorable. In most cases, the pancreatic lesion and retroperitoneal fibrosis improve after the initial treatment. However, the epidemiology, treatment for recurring retroperitoneal fibrosis, and long-term prognosis are still largely unknown. Further analysis of such cases and research are necessary."

Although this entity has been recognized for almost 70 years, recent developments in the genetics and imaging of VHL disease have greatly improved understanding of the disease and its natural history. This review describes the major events that led to the discovery of the gene for VHL and will familiarize the reader with recent developments in the magnetic resonance Imaging, computed tomographic, and ultrasound findings of this entity. Despite advances in the genetic understanding of this disease, imaging techniques will continue to play a major role in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of VHL.","von Hippel-Lindau disease: genetic, clinical, and imaging features. - von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes retinal hemangioblastomas, hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, endolymphatic sac tumors, renal cell carcinomas, pancreatic cysts and tumors, pheochromocytomas, and epididymal cystadenomas, among other less common manifestations.
